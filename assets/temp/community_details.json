Domestically, Iran is facing nationwide protests and human rights concerns, further complicating the country's geopolitical landscape.\n\nThe European Union, represented by the UK, France, and Germany, as well as the United Nations, have played significant roles in the negotiations and efforts to address Iran's nuclear program. Oman has also emerged as a key mediator, hosting indirect talks between Iran and the United States in an attempt to find a replacement for the 2015 nuclear deal.\n\nAdditionally, Iran is involved in a dispute over a US-brokered deal to develop a transit corridor in the Caucasus region, which could have implications for the country's regional access and influence. The complex web of international negotiations, domestic challenges, and regional disputes suggests that Iran is facing a multifaceted set of issues that could have significant consequences for regional and global stability.",
