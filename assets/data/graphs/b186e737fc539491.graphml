      <data key="d2">25.0</data>
      <data key="d5">A Tropical Cyclone is a rapidly rotating storm system characterized by a low-pressure center, a closed low-level atmospheric circulation, strong winds, and a spiral arrangement of thunderstorms that produce heavy rain. These storm systems originate over tropical or subtropical waters and have a closed low-level circulation.

Tropical cyclones are powerful weather events that can cause significant damage and loss of life. They are typically classified based on their maximum sustained wind speed, with the strongest being categorized as hurricanes or typhoons. These storms can bring a range of hazardous conditions, including high winds, heavy rainfall, storm surges, and tornadoes.

The formation of a tropical cyclone begins with the development of a low-pressure area over warm ocean waters. As the warm, moist air rises, it creates a spiral pattern of thunderstorms and wind. The rotation of the Earth, known as the Coriolis effect, causes the storm to spin, and the low-pressure center, or "eye," forms at the center of the system.

As the tropical cyclone intensifies, it can produce winds exceeding 150 miles per hour (240 kilometers per hour) and generate massive amounts of rainfall. The spiral bands of thunderstorms can extend hundreds of miles from the storm's center, and the storm's eye can be as large as 50 miles (80 kilometers) in diameter.

Tropical cyclones can have a devastating impact on coastal regions, causing widespread destruction to infrastructure, agriculture, and human settlements. The combination of high winds, heavy rainfall, and storm surges can lead to flooding, landslides, and the destruction of buildings, roads, and other critical infrastructure.

In addition to the immediate impact of the storm, tropical cyclones can also have long-lasting effects on the environment and local communities. The heavy rainfall can lead to soil erosion and the contamination of water sources, while the storm surge can cause significant damage to coastal ecosystems, such as mangrove forests and coral reefs.

To mitigate the impact of tropical cyclones, many regions have developed early warning systems and emergency response plans. These efforts aim to help communities prepare for and respond to these powerful storms, reducing the loss of life and minimizing the damage to property and infrastructure.</data>

      <data key="d5">Storm Surge

Storm surge is the abnormal rise in seawater level during a storm, measured as the height of the water above the normal predicted astronomical tide. It is the rise in water level caused by the winds of a hurricane, which can lead to severe flooding in coastal areas.

The primary cause of storm surge is the strong winds associated with a storm, such as a hurricane or cyclone. As the storm moves over the ocean, the winds push the water towards the shore, causing the water level to rise significantly above the normal tide level. This can result in devastating flooding, particularly in low-lying coastal areas.

The height of the storm surge depends on several factors, including the storm's intensity, size, forward speed, and the shape of the coastline. Larger and more intense storms, such as major hurricanes, can generate higher storm surges, often reaching several meters in height. The shape of the coastline can also play a role, with bays, estuaries, and other geographic features that funnel the water inland leading to even higher storm surge levels.

Storm surge can be a significant threat to coastal communities, causing widespread damage to infrastructure, homes, and businesses. It can also lead to loss of life, as the combination of high water levels and strong currents can make it extremely dangerous for people to remain in affected areas. In addition to the immediate flooding, storm surge can also cause long-term damage to coastal ecosystems, such as wetlands and beaches, which can take years to recover.

To mitigate the risks of storm surge, coastal communities often implement various preparedness and response measures, such as early warning systems, evacuation plans, and the construction of seawalls or other protective infrastructure. Understanding the potential for storm surge and taking appropriate actions can help save lives and minimize the impact of these devastating events.</data>

A hurricane is a large, powerful, and swirling storm that forms over warm ocean waters. These storms are characterized by a broad, counterclockwise rotation and can bring a range of destructive weather phenomena, including high winds, heavy rainfall, storm surges, coastal flooding, and tornadoes.

Hurricanes are large-scale, powerful storms that can have a devastating impact on the areas they affect. They produce strong winds that can reach speeds of over 150 miles per hour, which can cause significant damage to buildings, infrastructure, and vegetation. The strong winds also push ocean water onshore, leading to storm surge flooding that can submerge communities miles away from the coast.

In addition to the high winds, hurricanes also bring heavy rainfall, which can lead to inland flooding. This flooding can be exacerbated by the storm surge, as the combination of high water levels and heavy rainfall can overwhelm drainage systems and cause widespread damage. Hurricanes can also spawn tornadoes, which can further add to the destruction caused by the storm.

The combination of strong winds, storm surge, and heavy rainfall can have a devastating impact on the areas affected by a hurricane. Coastal communities are particularly vulnerable, as they are exposed to the full force of the storm's winds and storm surge. Inland areas can also be impacted by the heavy rainfall and flooding, which can cause significant damage to homes, businesses, and infrastructure.

Overall, hurricanes are powerful and destructive storms that can have a significant impact on the areas they affect. They require careful preparation and response efforts to minimize the loss of life and property, and to aid in the recovery and rebuilding process in the aftermath of the storm.</data>

A tropical depression is the weakest form of a tropical cyclone, a weather system characterized by a low-pressure area and the circular motion of winds. According to the descriptions provided, a tropical depression is defined as a tropical cyclone with maximum sustained surface winds of 38 mph or less. 

While a tropical depression is the weakest type of tropical system, it can potentially strengthen into a more powerful tropical storm or even a hurricane. Tropical depressions form when a low-pressure area in the tropics, typically over warm ocean waters, begins to organize and develop a closed circulation of winds. As the system's winds increase, it can transition from a tropical depression to a tropical storm, and eventually, a hurricane if conditions are favorable.

Tropical depressions are closely monitored by meteorologists and weather agencies, as they can still pose a threat to coastal regions, even though their winds are relatively low compared to stronger tropical systems. Heavy rainfall, flooding, and the potential for tornadoes are some of the hazards associated with tropical depressions. 

In summary, a tropical depression is the initial stage of a tropical cyclone, characterized by maximum sustained winds of 38 mph or less. While it is the weakest form of a tropical system, a tropical depression can still bring significant weather-related impacts and has the potential to intensify into a more powerful storm.</data>
