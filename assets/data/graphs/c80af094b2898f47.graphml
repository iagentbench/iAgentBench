      <data key="d2">20.0</data>
      <data key="d5">TikTok is a popular social media platform that has faced some legal and regulatory challenges in recent years. 

Firstly, TikTok has settled a lawsuit related to concerns over the platform's impact on young users. The lawsuit alleged that TikTok's design and algorithms were harmful to the mental health and wellbeing of children and teenagers who use the app. While the details of the settlement have not been made public, it suggests that TikTok has acknowledged the need to address these issues and take steps to mitigate the potential negative effects of its platform on minors.

Separately, TikTok has also been accused of suppressing content that is critical of former U.S. President Donald Trump. California Governor Gavin Newsom has made this allegation, suggesting that the platform has engaged in censorship or content moderation practices that unfairly target certain political viewpoints. However, TikTok has denied these claims and maintains that it strives to be a neutral and inclusive platform that does not discriminate based on political affiliation or ideology.

Despite these challenges, TikTok continues to be one of the fastest-growing and most popular social media platforms, particularly among younger users. The app's short-form video format and algorithmically-curated "For You" feed have made it a go-to destination for entertainment, creative expression, and cultural trends. TikTok has also become an important marketing and advertising channel for businesses and influencers, as its user base continues to expand globally.

In summary, TikTok is a complex and multifaceted social media platform that has faced scrutiny and legal action related to its impact on young users and potential political bias. However, the platform remains hugely popular and continues to evolve, navigating the delicate balance between user experience, content moderation, and regulatory compliance. As TikTok's influence and reach continue to grow, it will likely continue to be a subject of ongoing debate and scrutiny.</data>

      <data key="d1">PERSON</data>
      <data key="d2">43.0</data>
      <data key="d5">Donald Trump is the former President of the United States. During his presidency, he had a combative relationship with California Governor Gavin Newsom on several issues.

One point of contention was Trump's deployment of the California National Guard to Los Angeles without the consent of the Governor. This was part of a broader feud between Trump and Newsom over immigration arrests and the Los Angeles riots. Trump also signed an executive order related to fire-destroyed homes in Los Angeles.

Additionally, Trump attempted to federalize the California National Guard, which would have given him more direct control over the state's National Guard forces. This was seen as an overreach of federal power by Newsom and other California officials.

Beyond California, Trump also took control of the Metropolitan Police Department in Washington, D.C. and deployed 800 National Guard troops in the nation's capital. This was in response to protests and civil unrest.

Lastly, Trump has been involved in a legal dispute with Newsom over the use of the National Guard in California. Newsom has also claimed that Trump's content was suppressed by TikTok, though the details of this allegation are unclear.

Overall, Donald Trump's presidency was marked by a contentious relationship with California's governor, Gavin Newsom, particularly around issues of federal control, the use of the National Guard, and responses to civil unrest. While Trump is no longer the president, the legacy of these conflicts continues to be felt.</data>

      <data key="d1">ORGANIZATION</data>
      <data key="d2">43.0</data>
      <data key="d5">The National Guard is a military force that can be deployed by both state governors and the President of the United States. It serves as a reserve component of the U.S. Armed Forces, with units organized at the state level and under the command of the state's governor.

In the case of the National Guard's involvement in events related to protests, riots, and immigration enforcement, there were some contradictory reports about the deployment and command of these forces. According to the information provided:

- The National Guard was deployed by President Trump to Los Angeles, as well as to California and Washington, D.C. to address protests and riots.
- The National Guard was also involved in a dispute between California Governor Newsom and President Trump, suggesting the Guard was deployed to California at the direction of the federal government.
- However, the National Guard was also reported to have been activated by President Trump to help contain riots in Los Angeles related to immigration arrests and deportations, implying the Guard was deployed by the federal government.
- Additionally, it was reported that the National Guard was federalized by Trump and deployed to California, further indicating federal control over the deployment of these forces.

To reconcile these contradictory reports, it appears that the National Guard was deployed to various locations, including California and Washington, D.C., by the direction of the federal government under President Trump. While the National Guard is typically under the command of state governors, in these instances, the President exercised his authority to federalize the National Guard and deploy them to address protests, riots, and immigration-related issues.

The National Guard's involvement in these events highlights the complex relationship between state and federal control over this military force. While the National Guard is primarily a state-level organization, the President can federalize and deploy them in certain circumstances, as was the case during the events described. This underscores the dual nature of the National Guard and the potential for tension between state and federal authorities in the use of this military resource.</data>

      <data key="d5">California is a state in the United States, located on the West Coast. It is the most populous state in the country and is known for its diverse geography, ranging from the rugged coastline to the towering mountains and vast deserts.

The current governor of California is Gavin Newsom, who has been in office since 2019. Newsom's wife, Jennifer Siebel Newsom, has served as the state's first partner since his inauguration. California has been the site of a legal dispute between Newsom and former President Donald Trump, with the federal government deploying forces to the state.

The state is also home to the 300 North Los Angeles Federal Building, a significant government facility. Additionally, the National Guard has been federalized in California, indicating a heightened state of security or emergency response.

California has a complex history with the death penalty. The last execution in the state took place in 2006, and the death penalty has been on pause for the past 20 years, suggesting a shift in the state's approach to capital punishment.

Overall, California is a diverse and influential state, with a mix of political, legal, and historical significance. The information provided highlights the state's role in national affairs, its leadership, and its unique legal and social landscape.</data>

      <data key="d5">The Metropolitan Police Department (MPD) is the primary law enforcement agency for the District of Columbia, responsible for policing the nation's capital. Contrary to the provided descriptions, the MPD has not been taken over by former President Donald Trump. The MPD remains an independent, municipal law enforcement agency under the control and oversight of the District of Columbia government.

The MPD is one of the largest police departments in the United States, with over 3,800 sworn officers and 600 civilian employees. It is responsible for a wide range of law enforcement duties, including responding to emergency calls, investigating crimes, and maintaining public order. The department is led by a Chief of Police, who is appointed by the Mayor of the District of Columbia.

While the MPD has faced challenges related to crime and public safety, as many urban police departments have, there is no evidence that the department has been taken over by the federal government or any individual, including former President Trump. The MPD remains accountable to the District of Columbia government and the local community it serves.

It is important to note that the provided descriptions, which suggest that the MPD has been taken over by Trump, are inaccurate and do not reflect the actual status and governance of the department. The MPD continues to operate as an independent, municipal law enforcement agency, responsible for upholding the law and protecting the residents of Washington, D.C.

In summary, the Metropolitan Police Department is the primary law enforcement agency for the District of Columbia, and it has not been taken over by former President Trump or any other federal entity. The department remains under the control and oversight of the District of Columbia government, as it has been throughout its history.</data>

      <data key="d5">Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is a federal law enforcement agency that has been the subject of significant controversy and criticism in recent years. 

ICE has been involved in a number of high-profile incidents that have drawn public scrutiny. In Los Angeles, ICE conducted immigration raids that led to protests at the 300 North Los Angeles Federal Building. These raids were seen by many as heavy-handed and inhumane tactics targeting immigrant communities.

Additionally, ICE has been implicated in deadly shootings in Minneapolis, though the details of these incidents remain unclear. The agency's use of force and its treatment of undocumented immigrants have been widely condemned by civil rights groups and political leaders, including California Governor Gavin Newsom, who has been critical of ICE's actions.

Despite the controversies surrounding the agency, ICE's stated mission is to promote homeland security and public safety by enforcing federal laws related to border control, customs, trade, and immigration. The agency is responsible for investigating a wide range of transnational crimes, including human trafficking, drug smuggling, and financial crimes.

However, ICE's aggressive approach to immigration enforcement, including the use of tactics such as workplace raids and detentions, has drawn significant criticism from immigrant advocates and human rights organizations. They argue that these tactics have led to the separation of families, the detention of individuals without due process, and the creation of a climate of fear within immigrant communities.

In response to these concerns, there have been calls for ICE to be reformed or even abolished altogether. Proponents of reform argue that the agency needs to adopt a more humane and targeted approach to immigration enforcement, focusing on serious criminal offenders rather than undocumented immigrants who pose no threat to public safety.

Overall, ICE's role and actions have been the subject of intense debate and scrutiny, with advocates on both sides arguing passionately about the agency's purpose, tactics, and impact on communities across the United States.</data>

      <data key="d5">Judy Siebel is the mother of Jennifer Siebel Newsom, a prominent American documentary filmmaker and activist. According to the provided descriptions, Judy Siebel quit her job after getting married, but she remained active in various volunteer roles.

Judy Siebel's decision to leave her job after marriage was not uncommon during her time, as many women of that era often prioritized their roles as homemakers and caregivers over pursuing full-time careers. However, the descriptions indicate that Judy Siebel did not simply retire from public life; instead, she continued to be actively involved in volunteer work and community service.

While the exact nature of Judy Siebel's volunteer activities is not specified, the descriptions suggest that she maintained an engaged and productive lifestyle, even after stepping away from her professional career. This dedication to community service and civic engagement likely had a significant impact on her daughter, Jennifer Siebel Newsom, who has also become known for her advocacy and philanthropic efforts.

The consistent portrayal of Judy Siebel in the provided descriptions, with no apparent contradictions, paints a picture of a woman who made a conscious choice to prioritize her family and community over her own career, while still maintaining an active and meaningful role in society.

      <data key="d5">Karen Bass is the Democratic Mayor of Los Angeles. She has been vocal in her views regarding the deployment of National Guard troops in the city.

According to the provided descriptions, Mayor Bass argued that the presence of the troops was not necessary and that their deployment only served to inflame tensions in the city. She made this argument alongside Gavin Newsom, the Governor of California.

The descriptions suggest that Mayor Bass believed the National Guard troops were not needed in Los Angeles, and that their presence could potentially escalate the situation rather than help to resolve it. This indicates that she took a stance against the deployment of the troops, preferring to address the issues in the city through other means.

It is important to note that the descriptions do not provide any additional context or details about the specific circumstances that led to the deployment of the National Guard troops or the nature of the tensions that Mayor Bass was seeking to address. Without this additional information, it is difficult to fully evaluate the merits of her argument or the potential consequences of the troop deployment.

Overall, the summary suggests that Karen Bass, as the Democratic Mayor of Los Angeles, took a position against the deployment of National Guard troops in the city, believing that their presence would only serve to exacerbate the existing tensions rather than help to resolve them. However, more context would be needed to fully understand the nuances of her position and the broader implications of the situation.</data>

      <data key="d5">Judge Breyer is a federal judge who has been involved in a legal dispute regarding the control of the California National Guard. According to the provided descriptions, Judge Breyer granted a preliminary injunction against the continued federalization of the California National Guard. This suggests that he ruled in favor of the state of California's control over the National Guard, rather than the federal government's control.

However, the descriptions also indicate that Judge Breyer's initial ruling was later overruled by a federal appeals court. This suggests that the appeals court disagreed with Judge Breyer's decision and ultimately sided with the federal government's authority over the National Guard.

It is important to note that the provided descriptions contain some contradictory information. While the first description states that Judge Breyer granted an injunction against the federalization of the California National Guard, the second description suggests that he ordered Trump to return the National Guard to Governor Newsom's control. This discrepancy makes it difficult to determine the exact nature of Judge Breyer's rulings and the outcome of the legal dispute.

In summary, Judge Breyer is a federal judge who was involved in a legal dispute regarding the control of the California National Guard. He initially ruled in favor of the state's control, but his decision was later overruled by a federal appeals court. The exact details of the case and Judge Breyer's specific rulings are not entirely clear from the provided information.</data>

      <data key="d2">37.0</data>
      <data key="d5">The Administrative Procedure Act (APA) is a United States federal law that governs the way in which administrative agencies of the federal government can establish and enforce regulations. The APA was enacted in 1946 and is cited by the plaintiffs as being violated by the federal government's actions.

The APA establishes the procedures federal administrative agencies must follow when proposing and issuing regulations. It requires agencies to provide public notice of proposed rules and to give interested parties an opportunity to comment on them before they are finalized. The APA also sets forth the procedures agencies must follow when adjudicating disputes or taking other administrative actions that impact the rights and obligations of private parties.

The APA is intended to ensure that federal agencies act in a fair and transparent manner, and that their actions are subject to judicial review. It provides a framework for the public to participate in the regulatory process and to challenge agency decisions that they believe are arbitrary, capricious, or otherwise unlawful.

The plaintiffs in the current case have alleged that the federal government's actions have violated the provisions of the APA. This could mean that the government has failed to follow the proper procedures for issuing regulations, or that it has taken actions that are not supported by the evidence or are otherwise contrary to law.

Overall, the Administrative Procedure Act is a critical piece of legislation that helps to ensure the accountability and transparency of the federal government's administrative actions. By providing a clear set of procedural requirements and avenues for judicial review, the APA helps to protect the rights and interests of the public and to promote good governance.</data>

      <data key="d5">Clarence Ray Allen was a convicted murderer who was executed in California in 2006. He had been found guilty of three counts of first-degree murder.

Allen's execution was significant as it marked the last time a death sentence was carried out in California. That year, no governor in the state commuted a death sentence or pardoned anyone on death row.

Clarence Ray Allen was convicted of orchestrating a murder plot from prison, where he was serving a life sentence for a previous murder conviction. In 1980, Allen hired a hitman to kill three people who had testified against him in the earlier murder trial. The three victims were killed in a shooting at a Fresno, California store.

Allen was subsequently convicted and sentenced to death for the three murders. He spent over 25 years on death row before his execution by lethal injection in 2006 at the age of 76. His case drew significant attention and controversy, with debates around the morality and efficacy of the death penalty in the United States.

Clarence Ray Allen's execution marked the end of an era in California, as it was the last time the state carried out a death sentence. The case highlighted the complex and often contentious issues surrounding capital punishment, and Allen's fate became a focal point in the ongoing national discussion around this practice.</data>

      <data key="d6">Here is a 500-word summary of the provided data:

Gavin Newsom and Donald Trump are involved in a legal dispute over the deployment of the National Guard in California. According to the descriptions provided, President Trump deployed the National Guard and Marines to Los Angeles, going against the wishes of Governor Newsom.

Gavin Newsom is the current Governor of California, having assumed office in January 2019. He is a member of the Democratic Party and has taken progressive stances on issues like climate change, healthcare, and immigration. Newsom has been a vocal critic of many of President Trump's policies during his time as governor.

Donald Trump is the 45th and current President of the United States, having assumed office in January 2017. He is a member of the Republican Party and has taken a hardline stance on issues like immigration and law enforcement. Trump has frequently clashed with Democratic state and local leaders, including Newsom, over a variety of policy disagreements.

The legal dispute between Newsom and Trump appears to center around the deployment of the National Guard in California. According to the information provided, President Trump sent the National Guard and Marines to Los Angeles, despite objections from Governor Newsom. The exact reasons for this deployment are unclear, but it seems to have been part of a broader effort by the Trump administration to assert federal authority over state and local governments, particularly those led by Democrats.

Newsom has likely challenged this deployment in court, arguing that it represents an overreach of federal power and a violation of California's sovereignty. Trump, on the other hand, may have justified the deployment as a necessary measure to maintain law and order or to respond to a specific threat or emergency situation.

It is worth noting that the descriptions provided are somewhat contradictory, as they do not clearly specify the context or timeline of the events in question. It is possible that there are additional details or nuances that are not captured in the information given.

Ultimately, this dispute between Newsom and Trump highlights the ongoing tensions and power struggles between the federal government and state governments, particularly when they are led by opposing political parties. The outcome of this legal battle could have significant implications for the balance of power between the states and the federal government, as well as the ability of state leaders to resist perceived overreach by the executive branch.</data>

      <data key="d6">Here is a comprehensive summary of the data provided:

Gavin Newsom, the Governor of California, is involved in a legal dispute with former President Donald Trump over the use of the National Guard in California. As the Governor, Newsom has authority over the deployment of the National Guard within the state. 

Newsom has objected to the federalization of the California National Guard by the Trump administration. He argued that the National Guard troops were not needed and that their presence would only serve to inflame tensions, rather than resolve any issues. Newsom is actively fighting against Trump's deployment of the National Guard in California.

The dispute between Newsom and Trump appears to stem from differing views on the role and necessity of the National Guard in the state. Newsom believes that the National Guard's presence is unnecessary and could potentially escalate the situation, while the Trump administration likely saw the deployment of the National Guard as a necessary measure to maintain order and control.

Despite the ongoing legal battle, Newsom, as the Governor of California, retains the authority to oversee the deployment and use of the National Guard within the state. This power dynamic has led to the current standoff between the state and federal government over the National Guard's role in California.

In summary, Gavin Newsom, the Governor of California, is engaged in a legal dispute with former President Donald Trump over the deployment of the National Guard in the state. Newsom has objected to the federalization of the California National Guard, arguing that their presence is unnecessary and could exacerbate tensions. The dispute highlights the complex relationship between state and federal authority when it comes to the use of the National Guard in domestic situations.</data>

      <data key="d4">Governor state...</data>
      <data key="d6">Gavin Newsom is the Governor of the state of California. In this role, he has taken several notable actions and positions.

As the Governor of California, Newsom opposed the deployment of troops to Los Angeles. This suggests that he has taken a stance against the use of military force in certain situations within the state.

Additionally, the state of California, under Newsom's leadership, filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration. This indicates that Newsom has been willing to take legal action to challenge federal policies or decisions that he disagrees with.

Newsom also has the opportunity, as the Governor of California, to issue mass death penalty clemency. This power could potentially be used to commute the sentences of multiple individuals on death row within the state.

Overall, Gavin Newsom's tenure as the Governor of California has been marked by his willingness to take bold actions and positions on a range of issues affecting the state. He has demonstrated a willingness to challenge federal policies, oppose the use of military force, and exercise his executive authority in ways that could have significant impacts on the lives of Californians.</data>

      <data key="d6">Here is a comprehensive summary of the data provided:

Donald Trump, the former President of the United States, has been involved in several incidents related to the deployment and control of the National Guard in various states, particularly in California and Washington, D.C.

According to the information provided, Trump attempted to federalize the California National Guard under 10 U.S.C. § 12406, which allows the President to call the National Guard into federal service. This led to a legal dispute between Trump and California Governor Gavin Newsom over the use of the National Guard in the state.

Additionally, Trump deployed the National Guard to California and Washington, D.C. to address protests and riots. Specifically, he directed the deployment of 4,000 California National Guard troops to help contain the riots in Los Angeles. Furthermore, Trump took control of the Metropolitan Police Department and deployed 800 National Guard troops in Washington, D.C.

The descriptions provided suggest that Trump's actions regarding the National Guard were aimed at addressing civil unrest and protests, though the specific circumstances and legality of his actions are not entirely clear. The descriptions indicate that Trump sought to exert federal control over the National Guard in these situations, which led to tensions and legal disputes with state authorities.

It is important to note that the provided descriptions contain some contradictory information, such as whether Trump "federalized" the National Guard or simply "deployed" them. To reconcile these contradictions, it appears that Trump attempted to assert federal control over the National Guard in these situations, but the extent and legality of his actions may have been disputed or unclear.

In summary, Donald Trump's involvement with the National Guard in California and Washington, D.C. appears to have been centered around his efforts to deploy and potentially federalize the National Guard to address protests and civil unrest, which led to legal disputes and tensions with state authorities. The specific details and legality of his actions remain somewhat unclear based on the information provided.</data>

CALIFORNIA is a state located on the west coast of the United States. GAVIN NEWSOM is the current Governor of California, having assumed office in January 2019. 

As Governor of California, Newsom has taken several notable actions. In March 2019, he declared a moratorium on executions in the state, halting the death penalty for as long as he remains in office. This decision was made despite California having the largest death row population in the United States.

Newsom has also been involved in a legal dispute with former President Donald Trump over the use of the National Guard in California. While the details of this dispute are not entirely clear from the provided descriptions, it seems that the federal government, under Trump's direction, deployed federal forces to California, which led to a conflict with the state's governor.

Additionally, the descriptions indicate that Newsom has been at odds with Trump on various issues related to the state of California. This includes the deployment of federal forces, which suggests a tense relationship between the state's Democratic leadership and the former Republican president.

Overall, the data provided paints a picture of GAVIN NEWSOM as a Democratic governor of CALIFORNIA who has taken progressive actions, such as the moratorium on executions, while also engaging in political conflicts with the federal government, particularly during the Trump administration. Despite these challenges, Newsom appears to be a prominent figure in California politics, leading the state through various issues and controversies.</data>

The descriptions indicate that the National Guard's deployment was related to demonstrations and riots that occurred in the city. The riots were reportedly sparked by issues surrounding immigration arrests and deportations, though the exact nature and details of the events are not entirely clear from the given information.

Despite the contradictory nature of the descriptions, it appears that the National Guard was brought in to help maintain order and control the situation in Los Angeles. Their presence was likely intended to provide additional security and support for local law enforcement in managing the demonstrations and any potential violence or property damage.

It's important to note that the deployment of the National Guard in such situations can be a complex and controversial issue, as it involves the use of military force in a domestic setting. The decision to call in the National Guard is typically made at the highest levels of government, and its implementation can have significant impacts on the local community and the overall political landscape.

In summary, the National Guard was deployed to the city of Los Angeles by President Trump to assist in containing demonstrations and riots that were related to issues surrounding immigration arrests and deportations. The National Guard's presence was intended to help maintain order and provide additional security support to local law enforcement during this period of civil unrest in the city.</data>

      <data key="d6">The U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) has been involved in a legal matter regarding a "FIRST EX PARTE APPLICATION MOTION FOR A TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER." Based on the provided information, it appears that there are two contradictory descriptions of the DoD's actions in this case.

The first description indicates that the DoD has filed an "opposition/response" to the motion for a temporary restraining order. This suggests that the DoD is opposing the request for a temporary restraining order and is seeking to prevent it from being granted.

In contrast, the second description states that the DoD has filed a "motion for a temporary restraining order." This implies that the DoD is the party seeking the temporary restraining order, rather than opposing it.

To resolve this contradiction, it is necessary to obtain more detailed information about the specific legal proceedings and the DoD's involvement. Without additional context, it is difficult to determine with certainty whether the DoD is the party seeking the temporary restraining order or the party opposing it.

However, based on the limited information provided, it appears that the DoD is involved in a legal matter related to a "FIRST EX PARTE APPLICATION MOTION FOR A TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER." The DoD has taken some action, either filing an opposition/response to the motion or filing a motion for a temporary restraining order itself. Further investigation would be required to fully understand the nature of the DoD's involvement and the specific legal proceedings.

In summary, the U.S. Department of Defense is involved in a legal matter related to a "FIRST EX PARTE APPLICATION MOTION FOR A TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER," but the available information is contradictory regarding the DoD's specific actions in this case. Additional details would be needed to provide a comprehensive and coherent summary of the DoD's involvement.</data>

      <data key="d6">Here is a 500-word summary of the provided data:

Donald Trump, the former President of the United States, is involved in a legal dispute with the governor of California, Gavin Newsom, over the use of the National Guard in the state. According to the descriptions provided, President Trump deployed the National Guard and Marines to the state of California.

The details of the legal dispute between Trump and Newsom are not entirely clear from the information given. However, it appears that there is some disagreement or conflict between the federal government, led by Trump, and the state government of California, led by Governor Newsom, regarding the deployment of the National Guard and other military forces within the state.

It is possible that Trump ordered the deployment of the National Guard and Marines to California for a specific purpose, such as responding to a natural disaster, civil unrest, or other emergency situation. However, the descriptions do not provide any further context about the reasons or circumstances behind this deployment.

Conversely, it seems that Governor Newsom may have objected to or challenged Trump's decision to send in the National Guard and other military personnel, leading to the legal dispute between the two leaders. This could be due to concerns about state sovereignty, the appropriate use of federal resources, or other political or ideological differences between the Trump administration and the California state government.

Overall, the provided descriptions suggest a complex and contentious relationship between the federal government under Trump and the state of California, with the deployment of the National Guard and military forces serving as a point of contention and legal conflict between the two sides. However, without additional details, it is difficult to fully understand the specific nature and underlying causes of this dispute.

It is important to note that the information presented here is based solely on the limited descriptions provided and may not reflect the complete or accurate details of the situation. Further research and investigation would be necessary to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the events and issues involved.</data>

      <data key="d6">The states of Oklahoma and South Carolina have jointly filed legal documents related to a matter of shared interest. 

The State of Oklahoma and the State of South Carolina have collaborated to file an amicus curiae brief, which is a legal document submitted by a party that is not directly involved in a case, but has a strong interest in the outcome. The two states, along with the State of Iowa, have come together to file this joint brief, indicating a shared concern or position on the issue at hand.

Additionally, the states of Oklahoma, South Carolina, and Iowa have filed a joint motion. A joint motion suggests the three states are aligned in their legal strategy and are taking coordinated action on a particular matter. The specific details of the motion are not provided, but the joint filing demonstrates the states are working in unison on this issue.

While the exact nature of the legal proceedings is not specified, the fact that Oklahoma and South Carolina have collaborated on both an amicus brief and a joint motion indicates a significant shared interest between the two states. The inclusion of Iowa as a third party further suggests this is a matter of regional or national importance, rather than a localized issue.

Overall, the State of Oklahoma and the State of South Carolina have demonstrated a willingness to work together, along with the State of Iowa, to advocate for a common cause through the legal system. The joint nature of their filings suggests a high degree of coordination and alignment between the two states on the underlying issue.</data>
