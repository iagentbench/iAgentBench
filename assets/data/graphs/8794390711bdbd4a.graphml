Overall, the descriptions paint a picture of Moree as a town grappling with issues of youth crime and the potential for extremist ideologies to take hold among its younger residents.

He is widely regarded as a contender for the role of NSW Police Commissioner, with the descriptions provided indicating that he is considered the "establishment favorite" for the position.

However, Mal Lanyon's candidacy for the top police job is not without controversy. While he is seen as the preferred choice of the current establishment, some of his critics have warned that his appointment would not bring about the meaningful change that some have been calling for within the NSW Police Force.

The descriptions suggest that Mal Lanyon is a well-respected and experienced police officer, having risen through the ranks to the position of Deputy Commissioner. His supporters likely view him as a steady and reliable leader who can provide continuity and stability in the role of Police Commissioner.

At the same time, his critics appear to be concerned that his appointment would perpetuate the status quo and fail to address the perceived need for significant reforms or a new direction within the NSW Police Force. This suggests that there may be a divide between those who see Mal Lanyon as the safe and predictable choice, and those who are seeking a more transformative leader to drive change and address any issues or shortcomings within the organization.

According to the information provided, there are some contradictions and uncertainties surrounding Dave Hudson's current status and future plans. One description suggests that he is a "rival contender" for the Commissioner role, implying that he is actively seeking the position. However, another description portrays him as a "silent candidate," raising concerns about his stance on important issues like Indigenous relations.

Additionally, there is some ambiguity about Hudson's current role and future plans. One description states that he is a "detective at the NSW Police" who is expected to retire before the end of the year, leaving another deputy commissioner role open. This suggests that he may be nearing the end of his career, rather than actively pursuing the Commissioner position.

Despite these contradictions, it is clear that Dave Hudson is a respected and influential figure within the NSW Police Force. He has likely accumulated a wealth of experience and expertise over the course of his career, which has contributed to his reputation as a potential candidate for the Commissioner role.

However, the concerns raised about his stance on issues like Indigenous relations suggest that he may need to be more transparent and vocal about his views and priorities if he wishes to be considered a viable candidate for the top job. The fact that he is described as a "silent candidate" could be seen as a potential weakness, as the public and the broader community may want to hear more from a prospective Police Commissioner about their vision and plans for the force.

In summary, Dave Hudson is a senior NSW Police officer who is considered a potential contender for the role of Police Commissioner. However, there are some contradictions and uncertainties surrounding his current status and future plans, which may need to be addressed if he wishes to be seen as a strong and viable candidate for the top job.</data>

Overall, the available information paints a picture of Mick Willing as a high-ranking police officer whose tenure was marked by internal conflicts, allegations of misconduct, and a sudden and controversial exit from the NSW Police.
