      <data key="d5">Salva Kiir is the President of South Sudan and the leader of the SPLM (Sudan People's Liberation Movement) party. He has been the President of South Sudan since the country's independence in 2011.

Kiir is a long-time political rival of Riek Machar, who was previously his deputy. The relationship between Kiir and Machar has become increasingly strained amid ethnic tensions and sporadic violence in the country. In 2013, Kiir and Machar fell out, which led to the start of a civil war in South Sudan.

As the President, Kiir is the leader of the South Sudanese government. He has ordered the arrest of Vice President Riek Machar, and the arrest was carried out under his directive. Kiir has stated that he will never return the country to war, despite the ongoing tensions and conflicts.

Kiir's presidency has been marked by political and ethnic tensions, as well as the civil war that erupted in 2013. However, he remains the current President of South Sudan and the leader of the SPLM party, which is the dominant political party in the country.

Overall, Salva Kiir is a central figure in the political landscape of South Sudan, serving as the President and the leader of the SPLM party. His relationship with Riek Machar and the ongoing ethnic tensions in the country have been significant factors in the country's political and social dynamics.</data>

      <data key="d5">South Sudan is the world's youngest country, having gained independence in 2011. However, since its independence, the country has been plagued by ongoing political and ethnic conflicts.

South Sudan is located in East Africa and has faced significant challenges in the years following its separation from Sudan. The country has been embroiled in a complex and volatile political situation, with tensions between different ethnic groups and factions vying for power.

One of the key events that has threatened the fragile peace in South Sudan was the arrest of Vice President Riek Machar. This incident has further destabilized the country and raised concerns about the future of the peace agreement that was in place.

Despite these challenges, South Sudan continues to be the setting for important events and developments. The descriptions provided indicate that the events described in the text are taking place in South Sudan, highlighting the country's continued significance on the regional and global stage.

Overall, South Sudan's journey since independence has been marked by poverty, insecurity, and ongoing political and ethnic conflicts. The country's young history has been tumultuous, with the arrest of the Vice President being a particularly concerning development that has the potential to further disrupt the fragile peace in the region. However, South Sudan remains a critical player in the East African landscape, and the events unfolding there continue to have significant implications for the country and the surrounding region.</data>

      <data key="d5">The United Nations Mission in South Sudan (UNMISS) is the UN peacekeeping mission in the country, led by Nicholas Haysom. UNMISS has been closely monitoring the situation in South Sudan and has issued several warnings about the country's precarious state.

According to the mission, South Sudan risks losing the "hard-won gains of the past seven years" if it returns to a state of war. UNMISS has expressed deep concern about the country's leaders being "on the verge of relapsing into widespread conflict." The mission has warned that the arrest of Riek Machar, a key political figure, leaves the country on the brink of widespread conflict.

UNMISS has been actively working to maintain peace and stability in South Sudan since its establishment in 2011, following the country's independence. The mission's primary mandate is to protect civilians, monitor and investigate human rights violations, and support the implementation of the peace agreement.

Despite the challenges, UNMISS has played a crucial role in the country's development, helping to facilitate the delivery of humanitarian aid, supporting the rule of law, and assisting in the implementation of the peace process. However, the mission has also faced significant obstacles, including ongoing violence, political instability, and a lack of cooperation from some parties involved in the conflict.

In light of the current situation, UNMISS has called on all parties to refrain from violence and to engage in constructive dialogue to resolve their differences. The mission has also urged the international community to continue to support South Sudan's efforts to achieve lasting peace and stability.

Overall, the United Nations Mission in South Sudan remains a critical component of the international community's efforts to support the country's transition to a more peaceful and prosperous future. As the situation continues to evolve, UNMISS will likely play a crucial role in monitoring and responding to developments on the ground.</data>

      <data key="d5">Upper Nile State is a state located in South Sudan. It is known for being an oil-rich region, which has led to renewed clashes between forces loyal to Riek Machar and Salva Kiir, the current president of South Sudan.

The state is home to Nasir County, which has been the site of recent fighting between government forces and the White Army, a militia group. The White Army is composed of members of the Nuer ethnic group, who have been in conflict with the government forces, which are largely composed of the Dinka ethnic group.

The fighting in Upper Nile State is part of the ongoing civil war in South Sudan, which has been raging since 2013. The conflict began as a political dispute between Machar and Kiir, but has since evolved into a broader ethnic conflict between the Nuer and Dinka people.

The oil resources in Upper Nile State have been a key factor in the conflict, as both sides seek to control the lucrative industry. The government forces have been accused of using violence and intimidation to maintain control over the oil fields, while the White Army and other rebel groups have attacked oil infrastructure in an effort to weaken the government's hold on power.

Despite the ongoing violence, the people of Upper Nile State continue to struggle to rebuild their lives and communities. The conflict has led to widespread displacement, with many residents fleeing their homes to seek refuge in neighboring countries or in internally displaced persons (IDP) camps within South Sudan.

Overall, Upper Nile State remains a volatile and unstable region, with the potential for further violence and unrest. The resolution of the conflict in South Sudan will be crucial for the future of the state and its people, who have endured years of suffering and hardship as a result of the ongoing civil war.</data>

      <data key="d2">10.0</data>
      <data key="d5">The 2018 Peace Deal was an agreement signed to end the civil war in South Sudan. The deal was reached between the forces of Riek Machar and Salva Kiir, the two main parties involved in the five-year civil war that had been raging in the country.

The civil war in South Sudan had been ongoing since 2013, just two years after the country gained independence from Sudan. The conflict was primarily between the forces loyal to Riek Machar, the former Vice President, and those loyal to Salva Kiir, the current President. The war had resulted in widespread violence, displacement of civilians, and a severe humanitarian crisis.

The 2018 peace deal was a significant step towards ending the conflict and restoring stability in South Sudan. The agreement was signed in September 2018 in the Ethiopian capital, Addis Ababa, after months of negotiations and mediation efforts by regional and international actors.

The key provisions of the 2018 peace deal included:

1. The formation of a transitional government of national unity, with Salva Kiir as the President and Riek Machar as the First Vice President.
2. The integration of the opposing military forces into a unified national army.
3. The establishment of a ceasefire and the withdrawal of all foreign and non-South Sudanese forces from the country.
4. The implementation of a comprehensive security sector reform and the disarmament, demobilization, and reintegration of former combatants.
5. The establishment of a truth and reconciliation commission to address the grievances and human rights violations that occurred during the conflict.

The 2018 peace deal was widely hailed as a significant step towards ending the civil war and paving the way for a lasting peace in South Sudan. However, the implementation of the agreement has faced several challenges, including delays, political tensions, and continued violence in some parts of the country.

Despite these challenges, the 2018 peace deal remains a crucial milestone in the history of South Sudan and a testament to the resilience and determination of the South Sudanese people to overcome their differences and work towards a peaceful and prosperous future.</data>

      <data key="d5">The White Army is an armed group that has been active in the conflict in South Sudan. It is largely composed of fighters from the Nuer ethnic group, the same as Riek Machar, a prominent political figure in the country.

The White Army has been described as a militia that is loyal to Riek Machar. During the 2013-2018 conflict in South Sudan, the White Army was allied with Machar and his forces. In March 2025, the White Army carried out an attack that killed 250 soldiers and a general, demonstrating their military capabilities and their willingness to engage in violent conflict.

Despite the descriptions provided, there are some contradictions in the information about the White Army. While it is clear that the group is associated with Riek Machar and the Nuer ethnic group, the exact nature of their relationship and the group's overall structure and objectives are not entirely clear.

It is possible that the White Army is a loosely organized militia that has shifted its allegiances and tactics over time, depending on the political and military situation in South Sudan. The group's actions, such as the 2025 attack, suggest that they are a formidable and dangerous force, capable of inflicting significant casualties on government and military targets.

Overall, the White Army appears to be a significant player in the ongoing conflict in South Sudan, with strong ties to Riek Machar and the Nuer ethnic group. However, the group's exact nature and the extent of its influence and capabilities remain somewhat unclear based on the information provided.</data>

      <data key="d5">The Revitalized Peace Agreement is a 2018 peace agreement that aimed to end the 5-year civil war in South Sudan and form a unity government. The agreement was intended to bring an end to the conflict that had plagued the country since it gained independence in 2011.

The Revitalized Peace Agreement was a significant step towards restoring stability and peace in South Sudan. It called for the formation of a transitional government, the integration of opposing armed forces, and the implementation of key reforms to address the underlying causes of the conflict. The agreement was welcomed by the international community as a positive development and a potential turning point in the country's tumultuous history.

However, the implementation of the Revitalized Peace Agreement has faced significant challenges. Despite the agreement, there has been a lack of trust between key stakeholders, and the inability to effectively address critical issues and implement agreed-upon reforms has hampered the progress. The unity government, which was formed as a result of the agreement, has struggled to maintain stability and address the needs of the South Sudanese people.

The civil war in South Sudan has been a complex and protracted conflict, with deep-seated political, ethnic, and economic divisions at its core. The Revitalized Peace Agreement was an attempt to address these underlying issues and pave the way for a lasting peace. However, the continued lack of trust and the inability to implement the agreed-upon reforms have made it difficult to achieve the desired outcomes.

Despite these challenges, the Revitalized Peace Agreement remains an important step in the ongoing efforts to bring peace and stability to South Sudan. The international community continues to support the implementation of the agreement and the efforts to address the root causes of the conflict. With renewed commitment and a concerted effort from all stakeholders, there is still hope that the Revitalized Peace Agreement can be successfully implemented and contribute to a lasting peace in South Sudan.</data>

He has played a significant role in the political landscape of South Sudan, particularly in the context of the ongoing conflict and power struggles within the country.

Machar is the leader of the Sudan People's Liberation Movement-In Opposition (SPLM-IO), a political faction that has been engaged in a protracted conflict with the government of South Sudan. He served as the vice president of South Sudan from 2011 to 2013, but was later dismissed from his position and accused of attempting a coup.

Machar's political career has been marked by both successes and controversies. He was a key figure in the struggle for South Sudanese independence, having been involved in the Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA) since the 1980s. However, his decision to rebel against the government in 2013 and the subsequent violence that erupted have led to accusations of human rights abuses and war crimes.

Despite the challenges he has faced, Machar remains a prominent and influential figure in South Sudanese politics. He has continued to advocate for a peaceful resolution to the conflict and has been involved in various peace negotiations and power-sharing agreements. However, the political situation in South Sudan remains fragile, and the future of Machar's role in the country's leadership remains uncertain.

      <data key="d5">Germany is a country that has temporarily closed its embassy in Juba, South Sudan due to the security situation in the region. The German embassy in South Sudan has been shut down as a precautionary measure to ensure the safety of its diplomatic staff.

South Sudan has been facing political and social unrest since gaining independence in 2011, with ongoing conflicts and violence between various factions. The security situation in the country, particularly in the capital city of Juba, has deteriorated in recent times, prompting the German government to take the decision to temporarily close its diplomatic mission in the country.

This move is a common practice among countries when the safety of their citizens and diplomatic personnel is deemed to be at risk in a foreign country. Germany, like many other nations, prioritizes the well-being and security of its representatives abroad, and the closure of the embassy in Juba is a prudent step to protect its diplomatic staff.

The temporary closure of the German embassy in South Sudan does not indicate a complete withdrawal of German presence or engagement in the country. Germany remains committed to supporting the people of South Sudan and contributing to the efforts to bring stability and peace to the region. The embassy closure is a temporary measure, and the German government will continue to monitor the situation closely, with the intention of reopening the embassy once the security conditions improve.

In the meantime, German citizens in South Sudan are advised to exercise caution and follow the guidance provided by the German government and local authorities. The German government remains dedicated to the well-being of its citizens and will continue to provide consular assistance and support to those in need.</data>

The two provided descriptions indicate that Norway has closed its diplomatic mission in South Sudan's capital city of Juba. This decision was made in response to the prevailing security challenges and instability in the region. 

Norway, as a sovereign nation, has the authority to establish, maintain, and if necessary, close its diplomatic representations abroad based on its assessment of the local conditions and the safety of its personnel. The temporary closure of the embassy in Juba suggests that Norway has determined the security environment has deteriorated to a point where it is no longer feasible or prudent to keep the embassy operational.

While the specific reasons for the closure are not explicitly stated, it is likely that the volatile political and security situation in South Sudan, which has been plagued by civil conflict and instability in recent years, has prompted Norway to take this precautionary measure to ensure the safety of its diplomatic staff. The closure of the embassy does not necessarily indicate a complete withdrawal of Norway's engagement or support for South Sudan, but rather a temporary suspension of its direct diplomatic presence in the country until the security conditions improve.

In summary, Norway has made the decision to temporarily close its embassy in Juba, South Sudan, due to the prevailing security situation in the country. This decision reflects Norway's commitment to the safety and well-being of its diplomatic personnel, while maintaining its broader engagement and support for South Sudan during this challenging period.</data>

However, the worsening security conditions in the country have prompted the embassy to take steps to ensure the safety of its personnel and British nationals residing in South Sudan.

The embassy has likely taken this action to minimize the risk to its employees and to ensure that essential diplomatic functions can continue to be carried out effectively.

Furthermore, the embassy has advised British citizens currently in South Sudan to consider leaving the country as a precautionary measure. This recommendation underscores the seriousness of the security situation and the potential for further escalation of the conflict.

      <data key="d5">The Upper Nile region of South Sudan is a complex and volatile area, marked by ongoing tensions and conflicts primarily driven by the competition for control over natural resources, particularly oil.

The Upper Nile region is a major source of tension and conflict due to the competition for resources. This oil-rich area has been a flashpoint for clashes between forces loyal to the opposing political factions led by Riek Machar and Salva Kiir. The fight for control over the valuable oil resources has been a significant catalyst for the renewed tensions and violence in the region.

The conflict in the Upper Nile has had a devastating impact on the local population, with an estimated 50,000 people displaced due to the ongoing fighting. The displacement of these individuals has further exacerbated the already precarious situation in the region, as communities struggle to access basic resources and services.

Despite the challenges, the Upper Nile region remains a strategically important area, both economically and politically. The oil reserves in the region are a valuable resource, and the control over these resources has become a central point of contention between the warring factions. The competition for this resource has fueled the ongoing conflict, as each side seeks to assert its dominance and secure the economic and political benefits that come with controlling the oil industry.

In summary, the Upper Nile region of South Sudan is a complex and volatile area, where the competition for control over natural resources, particularly oil, has been a major driver of the ongoing tensions and conflicts. The displacement of thousands of people and the continued fighting have had a significant impact on the local population, underscoring the urgent need for a peaceful resolution to the crisis.</data>

      <data key="d5">The Sudan People's Liberation Movement-in-Opposition (SPLM-IO) is the main opposition group in South Sudan, led by Riek Machar. It is a political party that has condemned the confinement of Machar as a violation of the constitution and the Revitalized Peace Agreement.

The SPLM-IO was formed in 2013 after a political dispute within the ruling Sudan People's Liberation Movement (SPLM) party, which led to a violent conflict between forces loyal to President Salva Kiir and those loyal to Machar, who was then the Vice President. The conflict resulted in a civil war that lasted for several years and caused widespread displacement and suffering among the South Sudanese population.

As the main opposition group, the SPLM-IO has been engaged in a protracted political and military struggle against the government of South Sudan. The party has accused the government of failing to implement the provisions of the Revitalized Peace Agreement, which was signed in 2018 to end the civil war.

The SPLM-IO has been particularly critical of the confinement of Riek Machar, its leader, who has been restricted in his movements and political activities since the signing of the peace agreement. The party has argued that this confinement is a violation of the constitution and the peace agreement, and has called for Machar's unconditional release and the full implementation of the agreement.

Despite the ongoing political tensions and the confinement of its leader, the SPLM-IO has continued to play a significant role in the political landscape of South Sudan. The party has participated in the formation of the Revitalized Transitional Government of National Unity, which was established in 2020 as part of the peace agreement.

Overall, the SPLM-IO remains a key player in the political and security dynamics of South Sudan, and its actions and positions continue to have a significant impact on the country's fragile peace and stability.</data>

      <data key="d6">Salva Kiir and Riek Machar are the two main political rivals in South Sudan. They have a long history of conflict and power struggles, which has been a major driver of the country's civil war.

Kiir is the current President of South Sudan, while Machar has served as the First Vice President under Kiir's government. However, their power-sharing deal has been unraveling, threatening a return to the civil war that has already claimed around 400,000 lives.

The tensions between Kiir and Machar have escalated over the years, with sporadic violence erupting between their respective forces. Their relationship has become increasingly strained, marked by ethnic tensions and a struggle for political dominance.

In 2013, Machar was Kiir's deputy when they fell out, provoking the start of the civil war in South Sudan. More recently, Machar was arrested on the directive of President Kiir, further destabilizing the fragile peace agreement.

Despite their long-standing rivalry, Kiir and Machar are seen as the two most influential political figures in South Sudan. Their conflict has had a devastating impact on the country, contributing to a humanitarian crisis and hampering efforts to achieve lasting peace and stability.

In summary, Salva Kiir and Riek Machar are the two main political rivals in South Sudan, with their power struggle and conflict being a central driver of the country's civil war. Their relationship has become increasingly strained, with sporadic violence and the unraveling of their power-sharing deal threatening to plunge the country back into conflict.</data>

      <data key="d6">Salva Kiir is the President of South Sudan and a key political figure in the country. He is the leader of the ruling SPLM (Sudan People's Liberation Movement) party and has been the President of South Sudan since the country's independence in 2011.

Kiir's presidency has been marked by political tensions and power struggles within the country. He is considered a political rival of Riek Machar, another prominent South Sudanese politician. Kiir has been seeking to sideline Machar politically for months, which has contributed to the current political crisis in the country.

South Sudan, the world's youngest nation, has faced significant challenges since its independence. The country has been plagued by civil war, ethnic tensions, and political instability. Kiir's presidency has been characterized by attempts to consolidate power and marginalize his political opponents, including Machar.

Despite the ongoing political turmoil, Kiir has remained the President of South Sudan. He has been accused of human rights abuses, corruption, and suppressing dissent, but has maintained his grip on power through the support of the SPLM party and the military.

The political situation in South Sudan remains volatile, with the potential for further conflict and instability. Kiir's efforts to sideline Machar and other opposition figures have contributed to the country's ongoing crisis, and the international community has called for a peaceful resolution to the conflict.

In summary, Salva Kiir is the President of South Sudan and a key political figure in the country. He is the leader of the ruling SPLM party and has been seeking to consolidate power and marginalize his political rivals, including Riek Machar. The political situation in South Sudan remains unstable, with the potential for further conflict and instability.</data>

Riek Machar is a prominent political figure in South Sudan, known for his role in the country's civil war. In 2018, Machar was a key signatory to a peace deal that aimed to end the long-standing conflict between his forces and those of President Salva Kiir.

The 2018 peace deal was a significant milestone in South Sudan's turbulent history. After years of devastating civil war, the agreement was seen as a crucial step towards reconciliation and stability in the country. The deal was signed by Machar, Kiir, and other key stakeholders, and it outlined a power-sharing arrangement and a roadmap for transitioning to a more inclusive government.

However, the fragility of the peace deal has been highlighted by the recent arrest of Riek Machar by the South Sudanese government. This action threatens to undermine the progress made through the 2018 agreement and raises concerns about the country's ability to maintain the delicate balance of power.

Machar's arrest is a complex and concerning development, as he was a central figure in the peace deal and his participation was seen as crucial for its success. The government's decision to detain him has sparked fears that the hard-won progress towards ending the civil war may be in jeopardy.

Despite the challenges, the 2018 peace deal remains an important milestone in South Sudan's history. It represented a significant effort by all parties to find a peaceful resolution to the conflict and laid the groundwork for a more inclusive and stable political system. The success of the agreement, however, is now in question due to the recent developments surrounding Riek Machar.

As South Sudan continues to navigate the path towards lasting peace, the international community will be closely watching the situation and the government's actions. The preservation of the 2018 peace deal and the inclusion of all key stakeholders, including Riek Machar, will be crucial for the country's future stability and development.</data>

He currently holds the position of First Vice President of South Sudan, a role he was granted under the 2018 revitalized peace agreement. Machar is also the leader of the main opposition party in the country and is part of the unity government.

However, Machar's political career has been marked by controversy. He has faced a number of criminal charges, including treason, murder, and other offenses. As a result, he has been suspended from his position as Vice President. The government of South Sudan has requested the support of the United States in prosecuting Machar for these alleged crimes.

Despite these legal issues, Machar remains a key political player in South Sudan. He is seen as a central figure in the country's ongoing political and social turmoil. The situation in South Sudan has been volatile, with the country facing a range of challenges, including civil conflict, economic instability, and humanitarian crises.

In this context, Machar's role and influence continue to be a subject of intense debate and scrutiny. While he maintains support from some segments of the population, his suspension from office and the criminal charges against him have raised concerns about the stability and future of South Sudan's political landscape.

Overall, Riek Machar is a complex and controversial figure in South Sudanese politics. His position as First Vice President, his leadership of the opposition, and the legal issues he faces all contribute to the ongoing challenges and uncertainties facing the country.</data>

      <data key="d6">Salva Kiir is the President of South Sudan and the leader of the ruling SPLM (Sudan People's Liberation Movement) party. As the head of state and government, Kiir has played a pivotal role in the political landscape of South Sudan since the country's independence in 2011.

The SPLM is the dominant political party in South Sudan and has been the ruling party since the country's formation. Kiir has been the leader of the SPLM since 2005, when he assumed the position after the assassination of the party's founder, John Garang. Under Kiir's leadership, the SPLM has maintained its position as the primary political force in South Sudan, though the party has faced internal divisions and challenges over the years.

As President of South Sudan, Kiir has been responsible for guiding the country through the challenges of nation-building and post-conflict reconstruction. He has worked to establish a functional government, develop the country's infrastructure, and address the needs of its diverse population. However, Kiir's tenure has also been marked by political instability, ethnic tensions, and ongoing conflicts, particularly with the opposition SPLM-IO (SPLM-In Opposition) faction.

Despite the challenges, Kiir has remained a central figure in South Sudanese politics, leveraging his position as the leader of the SPLM to maintain his grip on power. He has sought to consolidate his authority and has been accused of cracking down on dissent and restricting political freedoms. At the same time, Kiir has engaged in various diplomatic efforts to seek regional and international support for his government and to address the country's pressing issues.

In summary, Salva Kiir is the President of South Sudan and the leader of the ruling SPLM party. As the head of state and government, he has played a pivotal role in the country's political landscape since its independence, though his tenure has been marked by both successes and challenges in the ongoing process of nation-building and conflict resolution.</data>

The UN mission has warned that the country risks returning to widespread conflict if the situation is not resolved.

UNMISS has been closely monitoring the situation in South Sudan, which has been plagued by political instability and violence since the country gained independence in 2011. The mission has been working to support the implementation of the 2018 Revitalized Agreement on the Resolution of the Conflict in South Sudan, which was intended to bring an end to the country's civil war.

However, the mission has expressed concern that the peace process remains fragile, with ongoing tensions between the various factions and a lack of progress on key issues such as security sector reform and the implementation of transitional justice mechanisms. The mission has warned that if these issues are not addressed, the country could slide back into widespread conflict, with the potential for a resurgence of violence and human rights abuses.

UNMISS has called on all parties in South Sudan to recommit to the peace process and to work together to address the underlying causes of the conflict. The mission has also urged the international community to continue to support the peace process and to provide the necessary resources and assistance to help stabilize the country.

Overall, the situation in South Sudan remains highly volatile, and the UNITED NATIONS MISSION IN SOUTH SUDAN has warned that the country is at risk of returning to widespread conflict if the situation is not resolved.

IGAD, the Intergovernmental Authority on Development, is expected to play a crucial role in mediating the ongoing conflict in South Sudan and ensuring the implementation of the Revitalized Peace Agreement. As the regional body, IGAD is poised to send a high-level delegation to Juba, the capital of South Sudan, to help resolve the complex and volatile situation in the country.

The conflict in South Sudan has been ongoing since the country gained independence in 2011, with political and ethnic tensions leading to a civil war that has caused widespread suffering and displacement. The Revitalized Peace Agreement, signed in 2018, was intended to bring an end to the conflict, but its implementation has been slow and fraught with challenges.

IGAD, which is composed of eight member states in the Horn of Africa and the Greater Horn of Africa regions, is well-positioned to play a crucial role in the mediation efforts. As a regional organization, IGAD has a deep understanding of the dynamics and complexities of the conflict in South Sudan, and it has a vested interest in promoting stability and peace in the region.

The high-level delegation that IGAD is expected to send to Juba will likely engage in a range of diplomatic and political activities aimed at facilitating dialogue between the warring parties, monitoring the implementation of the Revitalized Peace Agreement, and providing support and resources to aid in the resolution of the conflict.

IGAD's involvement in the South Sudan conflict is crucial, as the organization has a track record of successful mediation efforts in the region. In the past, IGAD has played a key role in resolving conflicts in countries such as Somalia and Sudan, and it is hoped that its involvement in South Sudan will help to bring about a lasting peace.

Overall, the role of IGAD in the South Sudan conflict is a critical one, as the organization's efforts to mediate the conflict and ensure the implementation of the Revitalized Peace Agreement could have a significant impact on the future of the country and the stability of the wider region.</data>

      <data key="d6">South Sudan, the world's youngest nation, has been embroiled in a civil war since 2013. The conflict, which has its roots in political and ethnic tensions, has had a devastating impact on the country and its people.

The civil war in South Sudan began in December 2013, when a political dispute between President Salva Kiir and his former Vice President, Riek Machar, escalated into a full-blown armed conflict. The fighting quickly took on an ethnic dimension, with Kiir's Dinka ethnic group and Machar's Nuer ethnic group becoming the main protagonists in the conflict.

The civil war has been characterized by widespread violence, including the targeting of civilians, the destruction of property, and the displacement of millions of people. According to the United Nations, the conflict has resulted in the deaths of tens of thousands of people and has led to a severe humanitarian crisis, with many South Sudanese facing food insecurity, lack of access to basic services, and the threat of disease outbreaks.

Despite numerous attempts at peace negotiations and the signing of several ceasefire agreements, the conflict in South Sudan has continued to rage on. The country has been plagued by political instability, with the government and opposition forces struggling to reach a lasting political settlement.

The civil war has also had a significant impact on the country's economy, with the disruption of trade and the destruction of infrastructure leading to a severe economic downturn. This, in turn, has exacerbated the humanitarian crisis, as many South Sudanese struggle to access basic necessities such as food, water, and healthcare.

In recent years, there have been some signs of progress towards a resolution of the conflict, with the formation of a unity government in 2020 and the implementation of a ceasefire agreement. However, the situation remains fragile, and the country continues to face significant challenges in its efforts to achieve lasting peace and stability.

Overall, the civil war in South Sudan has been a devastating and complex conflict, with far-reaching consequences for the country and its people. The international community has been actively involved in efforts to mediate the conflict and provide humanitarian assistance, but the path to lasting peace and reconciliation remains a difficult and uncertain one.</data>
