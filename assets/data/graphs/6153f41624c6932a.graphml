      <data key="d5">The California Department of Justice (CADOJ) is a government agency responsible for enforcing the law and protecting the rights of the people of California. In 2024, the CADOJ announced that the state had the second lowest number of homicides since 1966, indicating a significant decrease in violent crime.

However, the CADOJ has also taken legal action in other areas. The department filed a lawsuit challenging the assertion of federal jurisdiction by the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) over the state's pipeline restart plans. The CADOJ argued that PHMSA's claim of authority in this matter was erroneous, suggesting a potential conflict between state and federal oversight of critical infrastructure.

Overall, the CADOJ has played a dual role in 2024, both celebrating a reduction in homicides and asserting the state's authority in matters of public safety and infrastructure. The department's actions demonstrate its commitment to maintaining law and order, while also protecting California's interests against perceived federal overreach. The comprehensive summary of the CADOJ's activities in 2024 highlights the agency's diverse responsibilities and its efforts to address a range of issues affecting the state.</data>
