Wei was stationed on the USS Essex and allegedly took photos, videos, and documents about the ship and its systems to share with a Chinese intelligence officer posing as a naval enthusiast from the China Shipbuilding Industry Corporation. Wei was recruited over social media and paid thousands of dollars for this information. \n\nThe Department of Justice has announced Wei's arrest for alleged espionage, and the Naval Criminal Investigative Service (NCIS) has investigated his activities, including installing a listening device in his apartment and creating a ruse to access his phone. Wei's defense attorney, Sean Jones, has argued that prosecutors are overstating the secrecy of the documents Wei shared and are wrongly portraying him as someone with access to sensitive secrets.\n\nThe allegations against Wei and Zhao suggest a concerning pattern of Chinese intelligence efforts to recruit Chinese-born U.S. military personnel to obtain sensitive information. The potential compromise of classified information and the ability of foreign adversaries to gain insights into U.S. naval capabilities and operations could undermine the Navy's strategic advantages and put national security at risk.",
