The continued reliance on the dossier by the FBI, even after issues with its credibility were known, has fueled significant controversy and debate surrounding the entities involved, including Steele, Danchenko, and Bruce Ohr, a senior DOJ official who served as a backchannel between Steele and the FBI.
