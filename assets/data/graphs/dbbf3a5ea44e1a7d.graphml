      <data key="d5">The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) is a U.S. regulatory agency that investigated the investment bank Piper Sandler's record-keeping practices. The CFTC found that Piper Sandler had failed to preserve required business communications and allowed its personnel to use unapproved, off-channel communications. As a result, the CFTC ordered Piper Sandler to pay a $2 million civil penalty in September 2024.

The CFTC's investigation into Piper Sandler's record-keeping practices was part of the agency's broader efforts to ensure that financial institutions comply with regulatory requirements. The CFTC is responsible for overseeing the U.S. derivatives markets, including the trading of commodity futures and options, and it has the authority to investigate and take enforcement action against firms that violate its rules and regulations.

In this case, the CFTC determined that Piper Sandler's failure to properly maintain and preserve its business communications was a serious violation of the agency's record-keeping requirements. These requirements are in place to ensure that regulators and law enforcement have access to the information they need to monitor and investigate potential market manipulation or other misconduct.

The $2 million civil penalty imposed by the CFTC is intended to serve as a deterrent to Piper Sandler and other financial institutions, sending a clear message that the agency takes record-keeping violations seriously and will take appropriate enforcement action when necessary. The CFTC's investigation and enforcement action in this case are part of its ongoing efforts to maintain the integrity and transparency of the U.S. financial markets.</data>

      <data key="d1">ORGANIZATION</data>
      <data key="d2">10.0</data>
      <data key="d5">Piper Sandler Hedging Services LLC is an introducing broker that was charged and fined by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) for various regulatory violations.

According to the available information, Piper Sandler Hedging Services LLC was charged by the CFTC for failing to maintain and preserve records, as well as for failing to diligently supervise matters related to its business as a CFTC registrant. The CFTC also fined the company $2 million for alleged record-keeping violations.

The record-keeping and supervisory failures appear to be the primary issues that led to the CFTC's enforcement actions against Piper Sandler Hedging Services LLC. As an introducing broker, the company is required to maintain accurate and complete records related to its futures trading activities and to properly supervise its operations to ensure compliance with CFTC regulations.

The $2 million fine imposed by the CFTC suggests that the record-keeping violations were significant and widespread, potentially impacting the CFTC's ability to effectively oversee the company's activities and protect the integrity of the futures markets. The failure to diligently supervise matters related to the company's business as a CFTC registrant also raises concerns about the firm's internal controls and risk management practices.

It is important to note that the CFTC's enforcement actions against Piper Sandler Hedging Services LLC do not appear to be related to any allegations of fraudulent or manipulative trading practices. The focus of the CFTC's charges and fines seems to be on the company's administrative and compliance failures, rather than on any direct harm to customers or the broader market.

Nevertheless, the CFTC's enforcement actions against Piper Sandler Hedging Services LLC serve as a reminder of the importance of strict compliance with record-keeping and supervisory requirements for CFTC-registered entities. Failure to meet these regulatory standards can result in significant financial penalties and reputational damage, underscoring the need for introducing brokers to maintain robust internal controls and compliance programs.</data>
