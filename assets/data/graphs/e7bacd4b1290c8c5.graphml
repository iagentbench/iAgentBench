      <data key="d5">The Rapid Action Battalion (RAB) is a Bangladeshi elite anti-crime and anti-terrorism unit. It is a special law enforcement unit that carries out raids as part of various operations.

RAB was established in 2004 with the aim of combating crime, terrorism, and other serious offenses in Bangladesh. The unit is known for its aggressive tactics and has been involved in numerous high-profile operations targeting criminal and terrorist organizations.

One such operation was "Operation Devil Hunt Phase-2," where RAB conducted raids as part of its efforts to combat crime and terrorism in the country. The unit's involvement in this operation demonstrates its role in the government's efforts to maintain law and order and ensure the safety of Bangladeshi citizens.

RAB is considered an elite force within the Bangladeshi law enforcement system, with its members receiving specialized training and equipment to carry out their duties effectively. The unit is known for its ability to respond quickly to emergencies and its willingness to take on high-risk missions.

Despite its reputation for effectiveness, RAB has also faced criticism and allegations of human rights abuses. There have been reports of extrajudicial killings, enforced disappearances, and other forms of misconduct by some members of the unit. The Bangladeshi government has acknowledged these concerns and has taken steps to address them, including implementing reforms and increased oversight.

Overall, the Rapid Action Battalion plays a crucial role in maintaining law and order in Bangladesh, but its actions and methods have been the subject of ongoing debate and scrutiny within the country and internationally.</data>
