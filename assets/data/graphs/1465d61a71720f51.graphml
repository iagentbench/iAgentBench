      <data key="d6">The Electric Vehicle Council (EVC) has appointed Julie Delvecchio as its new Chief Executive Officer (CEO), replacing the previous leadership of Behyad Jafari and Samantha Johnson.

Delvecchio's appointment comes at a critical time for the EVC, as the organization works to accelerate the adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) in Australia. In her new role, Delvecchio will be responsible for leading the EVC's efforts to promote the benefits of EVs, advocate for supportive policies and infrastructure, and engage with key stakeholders across the industry.

With her extensive experience and expertise in the EV sector, Delvecchio is well-positioned to drive the EVC's mission forward. She will work closely with the organization's members, which include automakers, charging infrastructure providers, and other industry players, to develop and implement strategies that will make EVs more accessible and appealing to Australian consumers.

One of Delvecchio's key priorities will be to address the barriers that have historically hindered the widespread adoption of EVs in Australia, such as limited charging infrastructure, high upfront costs, and consumer awareness gaps. By leveraging the EVC's resources and partnerships, she aims to create a more favorable environment for EV adoption, ultimately contributing to the country's transition towards a more sustainable transportation future.

Under Delvecchio's leadership, the EVC will continue to advocate for policies and incentives that support the growth of the EV market, such as tax credits, purchase rebates, and investments in charging networks. Additionally, the organization will work to educate the public about the benefits of EVs, including their environmental impact, cost-savings, and technological advancements.

Delvecchio's appointment as the new CEO of the Electric Vehicle Council marks a significant milestone for the organization and the broader EV industry in Australia. With her extensive knowledge and proven track record of success, she is well-equipped to guide the EVC through the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead, as the country strives to embrace a more sustainable and electric-powered future.</data>
