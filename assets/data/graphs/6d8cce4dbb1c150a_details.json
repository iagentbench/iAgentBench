The details of the case are complex and contradictory, with Wood maintaining his innocence and claiming ineffective counsel, while his brother Zjaiton later admitted to being the actual killer. The case gained significant attention, with the Oklahoma Pardon and Parole Board recommending clemency for Wood and the Catholic Conference of Oklahoma advocating on his behalf. Ultimately, Oklahoma Governor Kevin Stitt granted clemency, commuting Wood's death sentence to life in prison without parole.
