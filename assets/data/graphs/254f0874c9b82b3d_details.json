The group's goal is to establish an independent Palestinian state, and it has used both political and violent means to achieve this aim, leading to its designation as a terrorist organization by several countries and international organizations.\n\nThe Hamas Politburo is the executive leadership body of the organization, responsible for setting the group's political agenda and decision-making processes. Several key figures within Hamas, such as Yahya Sinwar, Ismail Haniyeh, Saleh al-Arouri, and Izzat al-Risheq, hold positions on the Politburo, indicating their influential roles in the group's activities.\n\nHamas has sought to strengthen its ties with regional powers, such as Qatar, in an effort to secure political and financial support for the group's activities. However, the group's designation as a terrorist organization has made it difficult for it to engage with the broader international community.\n\nThe ongoing conflict between Hamas and Israel has contributed to instability and unrest in the region, with the group's military wing, the Izz al-Din al-Qassam Brigades, being responsible for numerous attacks against Israeli targets. In response, Israeli authorities have targeted senior Hamas figures in assassination attempts.\n\nHamas has also been critical of the Biden administration's support for Israel and the ongoing Israeli occupation of Palestinian territories.
