Rudd's tenure as Australian Prime Minister spanned from 2007 to 2010, and again briefly in 2013. During his time in office, he was known for his progressive policies and efforts to address climate change. However, his leadership was also marked by some internal political turmoil within his party.

After leaving the Prime Minister's office, Rudd was appointed as the Australian ambassador to the United States in 2016. In this role, he was responsible for representing Australia's interests and maintaining strong diplomatic ties between the two countries.

However, Rudd's ambassadorship has now come to an earlier-than-expected end. According to reports, this is due to criticism from U.S. President Donald Trump. The specific nature of the criticism is not entirely clear, but it seems to have led to Rudd's decision to step down from the ambassador role sooner than originally planned.

Despite this, Rudd remains a prominent figure in Australian politics and on the global stage. He continues to be involved in various international organizations and initiatives, particularly those focused on addressing climate change and promoting peace and stability around the world.

In summary, Kevin Rudd is a former Australian Prime Minister who has recently stepped down from his role as the Australian ambassador to the United States, reportedly due to criticism from President Trump.
