      <data key="d5">NSYNC is a popular American boy band that rose to fame in the late 1990s. The group was formed in 1995 and consisted of five members: Justin Timberlake, JC Chasez, Joey Fatone, Lance Bass, and Chris Kirkpatrick.

NSYNC's musical style was a blend of pop and R&amp;B, and they were known for their synchronized dance moves and harmonious vocals. The band gained widespread recognition and success, releasing several hit albums and singles that topped the charts around the world.

Justin Timberlake, who was one of the lead vocalists of the group, started his career with NSYNC. The band provided him with a platform to showcase his talents and launch his solo career, which has since become highly successful. While NSYNC was not solely founded by Timberlake, he was a prominent member and played a significant role in the group's popularity and success.

During their active years, NSYNC released four studio albums: "NSYNC" (1998), "No Strings Attached" (2000), "Celebrity" (2001), and "Greatest Hits" (2005). Some of their most well-known and popular songs include "Bye Bye Bye," "It's Gonna Be Me," "Tearin' Up My Heart," and "Pop." The group's music and performances were widely acclaimed, and they won numerous awards and accolades, including several MTV Video Music Awards and American Music Awards.

NSYNC's success and popularity were not without their challenges, however. The group faced some internal conflicts and tensions, which ultimately led to their hiatus in 2002. After a brief reunion in 2013, the members of NSYNC have since pursued their individual careers, with Timberlake emerging as a highly successful solo artist.

Despite the group's dissolution, NSYNC's legacy and impact on the music industry and pop culture remain significant. They are remembered as one of the most iconic and influential boy bands of the late 1990s and early 2000s, and their music continues to be celebrated by fans around the world.</data>

      <data key="d5">"Blade: Trinity" is a film that features a diverse cast of actors. While the descriptions provided contain some contradictory information, a comprehensive summary can be compiled.

Blade: Trinity is an action-horror film that was released in 2004. The movie is part of the Blade film series, which centers around the character of Blade, a half-human, half-vampire who hunts down and kills vampires. In Blade: Trinity, Blade is forced to team up with a group of vampire hunters to take down a powerful vampire named Dracula, who has been resurrected.

The film stars Wesley Snipes in the lead role of Blade, reprising his character from the previous Blade films. While the descriptions provided do not mention Wesley Snipes, he is widely recognized as the main actor in the Blade franchise.

The descriptions also mention the involvement of two other actors in Blade: Trinity - Jessica Biel and Justin Timberlake. Jessica Biel is confirmed to have appeared in the film, portraying the character of Abigail Whistler, a vampire hunter who assists Blade in his mission. However, the claim that Justin Timberlake starred in the movie is inaccurate. Timberlake did not have a starring role in Blade: Trinity, but rather had a supporting role as a vampire hunter named Hannibal King.

In summary, Blade: Trinity is an action-packed film that features a talented cast, led by Wesley Snipes as the titular character Blade. The movie also stars Jessica Biel as a vampire hunter, while Justin Timberlake had a supporting role as another vampire hunter. The film follows Blade's efforts to take down the resurrected Dracula, with the help of a group of vampire hunters.</data>
