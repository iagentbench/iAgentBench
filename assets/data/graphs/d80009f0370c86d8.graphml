      <data key="d0">DONALD TRUMP</data>
      <data key="d1">PERSON</data>
      <data key="d2">4.0</data>
      <data key="d5">Donald Trump is the former President of the United States who has been involved in several high-profile legal cases. 

Trump served as the 45th President of the United States from 2017 to 2021. During his presidency, he was a controversial and polarizing figure, known for his brash and unconventional style of leadership. 

After leaving office, Trump has continued to be a prominent figure in American politics. He is currently the presumptive Republican nominee for president in 2024 and is involved in a high-profile trial in New York related to hush money payments made during his 2016 presidential campaign.

The details of the New York trial are still unfolding, but it appears that Trump has been convicted in this case. The trial is related to allegations that Trump directed his former personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, to make illegal hush money payments to two women who claimed to have had affairs with Trump, in an effort to suppress the stories during the 2016 election.

Despite this conviction, Trump remains a influential figure within the Republican Party. He has continued to maintain a strong base of support among his supporters, who view him as a political outsider and champion of conservative values.

It's worth noting that the descriptions provided about Trump's legal troubles and convictions are somewhat contradictory. While some sources indicate that he has been convicted, others suggest that he is still on trial. It's possible that the information is not fully up-to-date or that there are ongoing developments in the case.

Overall, Donald Trump remains a complex and controversial figure in American politics. His legal troubles and ongoing involvement in the political process continue to be closely watched and debated by the public and the media.</data>
