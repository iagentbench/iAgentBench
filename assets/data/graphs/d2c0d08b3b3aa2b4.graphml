      <data key="d5">Based on the information provided, Eddie Davis is Alicia Navarro's boyfriend who was living with her on the Fort Belknap Reservation in Montana. The descriptions indicate that Eddie Davis is significantly older than Alicia Navarro, with some reports stating he is twice her age.

Eddie Davis previously worked the night shift at a local Walmart store, but was allegedly fired for becoming "increasingly aggressive" towards his younger co-workers. He was also reported to have told his Walmart co-workers that Alicia was his niece, which appears to have been a deception.

After losing his job at Walmart, Eddie Davis went on to work at a marijuana dispensary, but lost that job as well. The descriptions suggest that the local community on the Fort Belknap Reservation has met Eddie Davis with disgust, likely due to the significant age gap between him and Alicia Navarro.

Notably, Eddie Davis has a concerning criminal history. He pleaded guilty to possessing child sex abuse images and was living with Alicia Navarro when she was found in 2023. This raises serious questions about the nature of their relationship and the potential exploitation of Alicia by the much older Eddie Davis.

In summary, Eddie Davis is Alicia Navarro's much older boyfriend who was living with her on the Fort Belknap Reservation in Montana. He has a history of aggressive behavior and criminal activity, which has led to significant community concern and disgust regarding his relationship with the much younger Alicia Navarro.</data>

Alicia Navarro and Eddie Davis were in a relationship and had been living together for over a year in Montana, despite the significant age gap between them. Navarro, who was 18 years old, and Davis, who was 26 years old, were seen packing up and fleeing their apartment in Havre, Montana together. 

Prior to their disappearance, Navarro and Davis had been living on the Fort Belknap Reservation in Montana. Navarro referred to Davis as her "uncle," though it is unclear if they were actually related. The two were moving their belongings together, indicating they were cohabiting.

After Navarro went missing in 2019, she resurfaced in 2023 and was found to be living with Davis in Montana. However, Davis was later charged with possessing child sex abuse images, which was not directly related to Navarro's disappearance.

Despite the age difference and Davis' criminal charges, there is no indication that he was involved in Navarro's initial 2019 disappearance. The two appear to have been in a relationship and living together during the time Navarro was missing, as well as when she was found in 2023.

In summary, Alicia Navarro and Eddie Davis were in a relationship and cohabiting in Montana, with Navarro referring to Davis as her "uncle." After Navarro's 2019 disappearance, she was found living with Davis in 2023, though he was later charged with unrelated child sex abuse crimes.

The MMIW movement is a grassroots initiative that aims to raise awareness and seek justice for the disproportionate number of indigenous women and girls who have gone missing or been murdered, often at the hands of intimate partners or acquaintances. The movement has been particularly concerned about Alicia's situation, as they believe she may be in a dangerous relationship with Eddie Davis.
