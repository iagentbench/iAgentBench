Donald Trump and NVIDIA

Donald Trump, the former President of the United States, had a significant impact on NVIDIA, a leading technology company known for its graphics processing units (GPUs) and artificial intelligence (AI) chips.

During Trump's presidency, his administration imposed a ban on the export of US-made chips to China, which included NVIDIA's most advanced AI chips. This ban was seen as a part of the ongoing trade and technology tensions between the US and China.
