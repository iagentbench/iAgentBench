"explanation": "Storm surge is one of the biggest threats from tropical cyclones, often causing more fatalities than wind. Tropical cyclones, which include hurricanes, can cause dangerous storm surge, which is an abnormal rise in sea level. The height of the storm surge depends on factors such as the storm's intensity, size, forward speed, and the shape of the coastline. Stronger hurricanes with higher winds can push more water towards the shore, resulting in a more severe storm surge. Larger hurricanes with a bigger diameter of strong winds can also blow more water towards the coast, leading to a more extensive storm surge. Slow-moving hurricanes that batter the coastline for hours can cause the surge to move farther inland. The location of the hurricane's eye relative to the coastline can also significantly impact the severity and location of the storm surge. Additionally, the shape of the ocean floor, or bathymetry, can influence how easily water moves inland and the resulting storm surge impacts. [Data: Relationships (61, 28, 157, 158, 159, 160, 161)]",

These storm systems originate over tropical or subtropical waters and can cause significant damage and loss of life. Tropical cyclones can bring a range of hazardous conditions, including high winds, heavy rainfall, storm surges, and tornadoes. The formation of a tropical cyclone begins with the development of a low-pressure area over warm ocean waters, and as the system intensifies, it can produce winds exceeding 150 miles per hour and generate massive amounts of rainfall. Tropical cyclones can have a devastating impact on coastal regions, causing widespread destruction to infrastructure, agriculture, and human settlements.

Tropical depressions, which have maximum sustained surface winds of 38 mph or less, can also transition into tropical storms and eventually hurricanes as the system's winds increase. Tropical depressions, tropical storms, and hurricanes are all closely monitored by meteorologists and weather agencies, as they can pose a threat to coastal regions, even if their winds are relatively low compared to stronger tropical systems.

The forward speed of the hurricane is another important consideration, as slow-moving storms can batter the coastline for hours, causing the surge to move farther inland. Additionally, the track of the hurricane relative to the coastline can greatly impact the location and severity of the storm surge, with the worst surge typically occurring just to the right of the hurricane's eye.
