      <data key="d5">The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) is the federal investigative agency in India that has taken over the investigation of several high-profile cases, including the Kolkata rape and murder case and the R G Kar doctor rape and murder case.

According to the provided descriptions, the CBI took custody of Sanjay Roy and is investigating the R G Kar doctor rape and murder case. The CBI also took over the investigation of the Kolkata case after the Calcutta High Court order, taking the case from the Kolkata Police.

The CBI is the federal agency responsible for conducting investigations into crimes that have national or interstate implications. It is often called upon to take over high-profile cases from local law enforcement agencies when there are concerns about the impartiality or effectiveness of the local investigation.

In the Kolkata rape and murder case, the CBI's involvement came after the Calcutta High Court ordered the agency to take over the investigation. This suggests that there were concerns about the Kolkata Police's handling of the case, and the CBI was brought in to ensure a more impartial and thorough investigation.

Similarly, in the R G Kar doctor rape and murder case, the CBI has taken custody of the accused, Sanjay Roy, and is leading the investigation. This indicates that the CBI has taken a direct role in this case as well, likely due to the sensitive nature of the crime and the need for a federal-level investigation.

By taking over these investigations, the CBI aims to ensure that justice is served and that the perpetrators are held accountable, regardless of their position or influence.</data>

      <data key="d6">The Kolkata Police and the Calcutta High Court are two prominent institutions in the city of Kolkata, India. According to the information provided, the Calcutta High Court has directed the Kolkata Police to turn over an investigation to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI).

The Calcutta High Court, which is the oldest High Court in India, has ordered the transfer of the probe from the Kolkata Police to the CBI. This decision by the High Court suggests that there may have been some concerns or issues with the investigation being conducted by the Kolkata Police, leading the court to believe that the CBI would be better equipped to handle the matter.

The Kolkata Police, on the other hand, is the law enforcement agency responsible for maintaining law and order in the city of Kolkata. As the primary investigative body in the city, the Kolkata Police would have been initially tasked with handling the investigation that has now been transferred to the CBI.

It is important to note that the descriptions provided do not indicate the specific nature of the investigation or the reasons behind the Calcutta High Court's decision to transfer the probe to the CBI. However, the court's directive suggests that there may have been concerns about the impartiality or effectiveness of the Kolkata Police's handling of the investigation.

In such cases, the involvement of the CBI, which is a premier investigative agency under the Government of India, is often seen as a way to ensure a more thorough and unbiased investigation. The CBI's expertise and resources may be better suited to address the complexities of the case, leading the Calcutta High Court to order the transfer of the probe.

Overall, the summary highlights the interplay between the Kolkata Police and the Calcutta High Court, with the latter exercising its authority to ensure a fair and impartial investigation by transferring the case to the CBI. This decision by the Calcutta High Court underscores the importance of judicial oversight and the need for independent and transparent investigations, particularly in matters of public interest.</data>

      <data key="d6">The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and the Kolkata Police have been involved in the investigation of a high-profile case in Kolkata, India. According to the provided information, the Calcutta High Court has transferred the investigation from the Kolkata Police to the CBI due to a lack of confidence in the Kolkata Police's investigation.

The case in question is the rape and murder of a doctor in Kolkata. The probe into this incident was initially handled by the Kolkata Police, but the Calcutta High Court has now ordered the transfer of the investigation to the CBI.

The decision to transfer the case to the CBI suggests that the Calcutta High Court was not satisfied with the progress or the handling of the investigation by the Kolkata Police. The lack of confidence in the Kolkata Police's investigation has led to the CBI taking over the case.

The CBI, as the premier investigative agency of the Government of India, is now responsible for conducting a thorough and impartial investigation into the doctor's rape and murder. The CBI is known for its expertise in handling complex cases and its ability to conduct investigations without any external influence or bias.

The transfer of the case to the CBI is a significant development, as it indicates the seriousness with which the Calcutta High Court is treating this case. The CBI's involvement is expected to bring a fresh perspective and a renewed focus to the investigation, with the aim of ensuring that justice is served.

It is important to note that the decision to transfer the case to the CBI was made by the Calcutta High Court, which suggests that the court was not satisfied with the progress or the handling of the investigation by the Kolkata Police. This highlights the importance of maintaining public trust in the investigative process and the need for transparency and accountability in the handling of such sensitive cases.

In conclusion, the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has taken over the investigation of the Kolkata doctor's rape and murder case from the Kolkata Police, following a Calcutta High Court order due to a lack of confidence in the Kolkata Police's investigation. The CBI's involvement is expected to bring a renewed focus and expertise to the case, with the aim of ensuring that justice is served.</data>
