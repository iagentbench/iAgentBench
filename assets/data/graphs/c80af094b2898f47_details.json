Trump has attempted to deploy the National Guard in California and other states as part of his response to protests, riots, and immigration-related issues, but has faced opposition from Newsom and other state authorities who argue that the National Guard should be under the control of state governors rather than the federal government. The legal battle has involved the State of California suing the Trump administration, with a federal judge initially ruling in favor of California's control over the National Guard, though this decision was later overturned. The Posse Comitatus Act, which limits the use of the military for law enforcement purposes, is a central issue in the dispute. The involvement of federal judges in the case has highlighted the complex legal and constitutional questions surrounding the balance of power between the federal government and the states in the deployment of the National Guard.",

Trump attempted to federalize the California National Guard and deploy them to address protests and civil unrest, leading to legal disputes with the state. These actions highlight the potential for tension and conflict between state and federal control over the National Guard, with broader constitutional and legal implications. The involvement of key Trump administration officials, such as Stephen Miller and Kristi Noem, further underscores the importance the administration placed on these issues.",
