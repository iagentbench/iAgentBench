During his presidency, Trump's leadership and policies were the subject of significant criticism and controversy, as evidenced by the public protests of composer Philip Glass against Trump's actions and decisions.

Trump's tenure as president was marked by both praise and criticism from various segments of the population, and the lasting impact of his presidency continues to be a subject of intense debate and discussion in the United States.

Madel's candidacy, however, demonstrates his interest and engagement in the state's political landscape as a member of the Republican party. His withdrawal from the race was at least partially attributed to his concerns about Trump's immigration policy, which he cited as a reason for dropping out.
