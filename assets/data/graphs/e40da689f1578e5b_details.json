He has also voted on bills addressing topics such as antisemitism and hate crimes.\n\nPolitically, Paterson is affiliated with the conservative wing of the Liberal Party, and he has been involved in leadership spills within the party. He was also reportedly sounded out to run for the seat of Kooyong, previously held by another prominent Liberal politician, Josh Frydenberg.\n\nOverall, James Paterson is a central figure in this community, with a significant influence on the political landscape in Australia due to his legislative involvement, media presence, and conservative affiliations.",
