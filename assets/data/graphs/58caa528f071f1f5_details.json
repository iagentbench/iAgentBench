According to Amorn Pimarnmas, the president of the Structural Engineers Association of Thailand, fewer than 10% of buildings in Bangkok are earthquake-resistant.\n\nThis is due to a 2007 law that only requires new buildings to be designed to withstand earthquakes, leaving a large portion of the city's existing structures susceptible to seismic activity. The collapse of a high-rise building under construction in Bangkok during the 2025 Myanmar earthquake is a stark example of this vulnerability.

"summary": "The community revolves around the strategic importance of Somali port cities, particularly Bosaso, Kismayo, and Berbera, which have attracted the involvement of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) through its deployment of a \"functional geography\" approach. The UAE's actions in these port cities, including exploiting infrastructure and interfering in local politics, have been perceived by some as a violation of Somali sovereignty. \n\nThe UAE's facilitation of Israel's recognition of the secessionist entity of Somaliland has also been a source of controversy, as it has been viewed as an infringement on Somalia's territorial integrity. Additionally, the reliance of the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), a Sudanese paramilitary organization, on Emirati ports to receive weapons and mercenaries has further complicated the regional dynamics.\n\nThese developments highlight the delicate balance of power in the Horn of Africa and the potential for external actors to undermine the sovereignty and stability of countries like Somalia. Addressing these challenges will require a comprehensive and collaborative approach that respects the sovereignty of all nations in the region.",

"explanation": "Saudi Arabia is a key player in the Middle East region, with a significant influence on regional affairs. The country has been actively involved in the ongoing conflict in Yemen, where it has intervened militarily to halt the expansion of the Emirati-backed Southern Transitional Council. Saudi Arabia's involvement in Yemen is driven by its perception of the situation as a threat to its national security and strategic interests in the Red Sea region. The country views the Southern Transitional Council's expansion as a potential challenge to its influence and control in the area. [Data: Entities (89)]",

"explanation": "NEOM is a major project in Saudi Arabia located in the Red Sea region. NEOM is a planned futuristic city being developed by Saudi Arabia along the Red Sea coast. The project is part of the Kingdom's ambitious Vision 2030 plan to diversify its economy and reduce its dependence on oil. However, the development of NEOM has been affected by the regional tensions and conflicts in the Red Sea area, particularly the involvement of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) in the region. The UAE's actions in Yemen and Somalia have had an impact on the NEOM project, which is located in the same Red Sea region. The instability and security challenges in the Red Sea area, partly due to the UAE's role, have created uncertainties and obstacles for the NEOM project. [Data: Entities (101), Relationships (86)]",

"explanation": "The descriptions suggest that the UAE's involvement in the Yemeni conflict has threatened the progress of the NEOM project. The UAE has been a key player in the Saudi-led military intervention in Yemen, which has resulted in a protracted and complex conflict in the region. The instability and security challenges in the Red Sea area, partly due to the UAE's role, have created uncertainties and obstacles for the NEOM project, which is situated in the same geographical area. To address these challenges, Saudi Arabia may need to navigate the regional dynamics and find ways to mitigate the impact of the ongoing conflicts on its flagship NEOM project. This could involve diplomatic efforts to resolve the tensions in the region, as well as implementing robust security measures to protect the NEOM site and its workers. [Data: Relationships (86)]",

"explanation": "Despite the apparent contradictions in Saudi Arabia's actions, the country's overall approach seems to be guided by a desire to maintain its regional influence and protect its strategic interests. The country's military intervention in Yemen, for instance, is likely aimed at ensuring that the balance of power in the region remains favorable to Saudi Arabia's interests. At the same time, Saudi Arabia has also been a regional ally of Somalia, supporting the country's decisions and policies. This suggests that Saudi Arabia's foreign policy is multifaceted, with the country engaging in different ways with various countries in the region based on its perceived interests and strategic considerations.
