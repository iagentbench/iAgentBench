The EU has been involved in addressing regional conflicts, such as the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, by imposing sanctions on an Israeli settler accused of killing Odeh Hadalin. At the same time, the EU has been actively engaged in shaping international economic relationships through trade agreements, as evidenced by the free trade deal with India. Additionally, the EU has taken on the responsibility of regulating emerging technologies, such as AI, to ensure their responsible development and deployment. This comprehensive approach, spanning political, economic, and technological domains, demonstrates the EU's commitment to addressing a wide range of global challenges and its desire to play a significant role on the international stage.
