Key entities in this community include Pope John Paul II, who played a pivotal role in Bergoglio's career advancement, as well as Antonio Quarracino, the Archbishop of Buenos Aires who facilitated Bergoglio's ascent.

In 1992, John Paul II appointed Bergoglio as an auxiliary bishop of Buenos Aires, and in 1997, he appointed Bergoglio as the coadjutor bishop, designating him to succeed the current archbishop. Then in 2001, John Paul II elevated Bergoglio to the rank of cardinal, bringing him into the College of Cardinals and positioning him to potentially be elected as the next pope. Years later, in 2013, Cardinal Bergoglio was indeed elected as the new pope, taking the name Pope Francis.
