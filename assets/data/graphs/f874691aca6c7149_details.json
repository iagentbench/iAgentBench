"summary": "This community revolves around the Patent Trial and Appeal Board (PTAB), which is the division within the USPTO that handles patent validity challenges. The PTAB is involved in various types of patent dispute proceedings, including Inter Partes Review (IPR) and Post-Grant Review (PGR), which are the primary means by which patents can be challenged. The Fintiv decision, issued by the PTAB, has had a significant impact on these proceedings by establishing a framework for the Board to consider the potential for duplicative efforts and the efficient use of resources when deciding whether to institute a petition. Additionally, patents can be challenged in parallel proceedings in other forums, such as the International Trade Commission (ITC) and district courts, which can also impact PTAB decisions. The efficient use of resources and the avoidance of duplicative efforts are important priorities within this community.",
