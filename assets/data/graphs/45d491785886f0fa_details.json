He is currently the frontrunner for the Republican presidential nomination and is expected to win the party's nomination. Trump's political career began in 2015 when he announced his candidacy for the 2016 presidential election. Despite facing significant opposition from within the Republican party, Trump ultimately won the nomination and went on to defeat Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton in the general election. During his time in office, Trump implemented a number of controversial policies, including a travel ban on several predominantly Muslim countries, the construction of a wall on the US-Mexico border, and the withdrawal of the United States from the Paris Climate Agreement. He also faced significant criticism and investigations related to his business dealings and allegations of collusion with Russia during the 2016 election. Despite the controversies and challenges of his presidency, Trump remains a highly influential figure within the Republican party. He has continued to be involved in politics, endorsing candidates such as Herschel Walker in the Georgia Senate race. Trump has also hinted at the possibility of running for president again in 2024, though he has not yet officially announced his candidacy. [Data: Entities (100), Relationships (46)]",
