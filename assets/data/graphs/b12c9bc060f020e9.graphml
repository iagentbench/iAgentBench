      <data key="d2">6.0</data>
      <data key="d5">John Bolton is a former National Security Advisor to the President of the United States. He served as the National Security Advisor to President Donald Trump from 2018 to 2019.

Bolton is a veteran diplomat and foreign policy hawk who has held various national security positions in the U.S. government over the past few decades. He is known for his hardline conservative views on foreign policy, advocating for interventionist and unilateral approaches.

During his time as National Security Advisor, Bolton was involved in several high-profile foreign policy decisions, including the withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal and the imposition of additional sanctions on Iran. He also played a role in the administration's approach to North Korea, Venezuela, and other global hotspots.

However, Bolton's tenure was relatively short-lived, as he departed the Trump administration in September 2019 amid reported disagreements with the president on various policy issues. The circumstances surrounding his departure were somewhat contentious, with both Bolton and Trump offering differing accounts of the reasons for his exit.

Since leaving the administration, Bolton has been the subject of a classified documents probe by the FBI. The investigation is reportedly focused on whether Bolton improperly handled classified information related to his time in the White House. Bolton has denied any wrongdoing and has stated that he followed proper protocols in his handling of sensitive materials.

Overall, John Bolton's tenure as National Security Advisor was marked by his hawkish foreign policy views and his willingness to challenge the president on certain issues. While he played a significant role in shaping the administration's approach to various global challenges, his departure from the administration was not without controversy, and he has since faced scrutiny over the handling of classified information.</data>

      <data key="d6">Here is a 500-word summary of the provided data:

John Bolton, a former National Security Advisor, had his home and office raided by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) as part of an investigation into classified documents that Bolton may still possess. According to the descriptions, the FBI conducted the raids in search of classified materials that Bolton may have retained after leaving his government position.

The FBI's actions were part of a probe into classified documents, though the specific details of the investigation remain unclear. The descriptions indicate that the FBI raided Bolton's home in Maryland, as well as his office, in an effort to locate and retrieve any classified information that he may have improperly retained.

Bolton previously served as the National Security Advisor under the Trump administration from 2018 to 2019. In this role, he would have had access to a significant amount of sensitive and classified information related to national security matters. The FBI's decision to raid Bolton's residence and workplace suggests that they believe he may have kept some of this classified material, even after his departure from the government.

It is important to note that the descriptions provided do not offer any definitive conclusions about Bolton's actions or the outcome of the FBI's investigation. The raids appear to be part of an ongoing probe, and the full details have not been publicly disclosed. As such, it is crucial to avoid drawing any premature judgments and to wait for the investigation to be completed before making any determinations.

The FBI, as the premier federal law enforcement agency in the United States, is responsible for investigating a wide range of criminal activities, including the mishandling of classified information. The agency's decision to execute these raids on Bolton's properties indicates that they believe there may be evidence of wrongdoing or a potential breach of national security protocols.

In conclusion, the available information suggests that the FBI has conducted raids on John Bolton's home and office as part of an investigation into the potential mishandling of classified documents. While the specific details of the probe remain unclear, the FBI's actions highlight the seriousness with which they are approaching this matter. It will be important to monitor the progress of the investigation and any further developments that may arise.</data>

The Berkeley Police Department (BPD) arrested the musician Michael Bolton on January 29, 2025. According to the available information, Michael Bolton was taken into custody by the BPD on that date.

Michael Bolton is a well-known American singer and songwriter, famous for hit songs like "How Am I Supposed to Live Without You" and "When a Man Loves a Woman." He has enjoyed a successful music career spanning several decades.

The details surrounding Bolton's arrest by the Berkeley Police Department are limited based on the information provided. The descriptions state that Bolton was arrested by the BPD, but do not provide any additional context or specifics about the circumstances leading to his arrest. 

It's unclear what charges, if any, were filed against Bolton or why the BPD took him into custody. The descriptions do not indicate whether this was part of a larger investigation, a response to a specific incident, or related to some other alleged criminal activity. Without more details, the reasons behind Bolton's arrest remain unknown.

Given the contradictory nature of the information - with both descriptions stating he was arrested by the Berkeley Police Department, but providing different levels of detail - it's difficult to piece together a complete and coherent summary of the events. The core facts are that Michael Bolton was arrested by the BPD on January 29, 2025, but the specifics of why and under what circumstances remain unclear based on the data provided.

It's important to note that an arrest does not necessarily mean an individual has been found guilty of a crime. Bolton could have been detained for questioning, released without charges, or the case could still be ongoing. Without access to official police reports or court records, the ultimate outcome of this incident cannot be determined from the limited information available.

In conclusion, the Berkeley Police Department arrested the musician Michael Bolton on January 29, 2025, but the details surrounding the arrest and any potential charges or consequences remain unknown based on the data provided. This summary aims to capture the key facts while acknowledging the gaps and contradictions in the descriptions given.</data>

The San Francisco Police Department (SFPD) has arrested the musician Michael Bolton. According to the information provided, Michael Bolton was arrested by the SFPD on January 12, 2025.

The details surrounding Bolton's arrest are limited, but the available descriptions indicate that he was taken into custody by the SFPD. While the specific reasons for his arrest are not explicitly stated, the fact that he was apprehended by the San Francisco police suggests he may have been involved in some kind of legal or criminal matter within their jurisdiction.

Michael Bolton is a well-known American singer and songwriter, famous for his distinctive soulful voice and hit ballads from the 1980s and 1990s. Some of his most popular songs include "How Am I Supposed to Live Without You," "When a Man Loves a Woman," and "Time, Love and Tenderness." Bolton has enjoyed a successful music career spanning several decades, with multiple Grammy Awards and multi-platinum album sales to his name.

However, this recent arrest by the SFPD marks a concerning development in Bolton's personal life and public image. It is unclear what specific charges, if any, have been filed against him or what the circumstances leading to his arrest entail. The limited information provided does not reveal the nature of the incident that prompted the SFPD to take Bolton into custody.

It will be important for more details to emerge regarding this situation in order to fully understand the context and implications of Bolton's arrest. Depending on the severity of the alleged offense and the outcome of any legal proceedings, this event could have significant repercussions for the singer's career and public standing.

Until more information is made available, the summary must remain focused on the core facts presented: that Michael Bolton was arrested by the San Francisco Police Department on January 12, 2025. Any further speculation or analysis would be premature without access to additional details about the specific circumstances surrounding this incident.</data>
