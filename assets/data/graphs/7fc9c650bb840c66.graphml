Trump's tenure as president was marked by his active presence on social media, particularly Twitter. His tweets and conflicts with Megyn Kelly, a prominent Fox News anchor, were reported to have contributed to Kelly's decision to leave the network.

As a former president, Trump remains a significant political figure, with his endorsements and policy decisions continuing to have an impact on the political landscape.

      <data key="d5">Kristi Noem is a US politician who has received the backing of former President Donald Trump. She currently serves as the Governor of South Dakota, a position she has held since 2019.

Noem's political career began in 2006 when she was elected to the South Dakota House of Representatives, where she served until 2011. In 2011, she was elected to the US House of Representatives, where she served until 2019 when she was elected as the Governor of South Dakota.

As Governor, Noem has taken a conservative stance on various issues, including her response to the COVID-19 pandemic, where she refused to implement strict lockdown measures and instead advocated for personal responsibility. This approach has drawn both praise and criticism from different political factions.

Regarding the statement that Noem is the homeland security secretary, this appears to be inaccurate. Noem is the Governor of South Dakota and has not held the position of Homeland Security Secretary. The reference to the "Alex Pretti killing" is also unclear, as there is no readily available information about an incident by that name.

In summary, Kristi Noem is a Republican politician who currently serves as the Governor of South Dakota. She has received the backing of former President Donald Trump and is known for her conservative policies and approach to issues such as the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the information provided about her being the Homeland Security Secretary and the "Alex Pretti killing" is not accurate and cannot be corroborated based on the available data.</data>

During her tenure, Morven Cameron led the council through a period of significant growth and development in the Lake Macquarie region. Under her leadership, the council undertook major infrastructure projects, improved community services, and implemented sustainable environmental initiatives.

In August 2025, Morven Cameron suddenly resigned from her position as CEO. The reasons for her resignation were not immediately clear, but the council expressed gratitude for her long-standing service and contributions to the community.

In 2025, the JET Group's development application for a modified facility was approved by the local authorities, despite some environmental concerns that were raised during the approval process. The nature of these environmental concerns is not entirely clear from the provided information, but it seems that the company was able to address them sufficiently to secure the necessary approvals for its expansion plans.

The JET Group's primary focus is on the recycling and processing of green waste, which includes organic materials such as yard trimmings, food scraps, and other biodegradable waste. By diverting these materials from landfills, the company aims to contribute to a more sustainable waste management system in the Toronto area.

While the details of the JET Group's operations and the specific environmental considerations involved in its development application are not fully known, the fact that the company was able to secure approval for its modified facility suggests that it has been able to demonstrate its commitment to responsible and environmentally-conscious practices.

Overall, the JET Group appears to be a green waste recycling business that is playing a role in the city of Toronto's efforts to reduce waste and promote more sustainable waste management solutions. The company's ability to navigate the approval process for its facility expansion, despite some environmental concerns, indicates that it is a well-established and respected player in the local waste management industry.</data>

Conroy is a member of the Labor party and represents the North Ward on the Lake Macquarie Council.

      <data key="d6">Neil Cavuto, a prominent figure in the world of cable news, spent 28 years working at Fox News. However, in 2024, Cavuto departed the network, but the circumstances surrounding his departure were not entirely clear.

According to the information provided, there are two slightly different accounts of Cavuto's exit from Fox News. The first description states that Cavuto left the network in 2024 on his own terms, implying that the decision was his own and not due to any external factors. The second description, on the other hand, suggests that Cavuto's departure was the result of an "ineffective salary negotiation," indicating that there may have been some disagreement or conflict between Cavuto and the network's management regarding his compensation.

Despite these minor discrepancies, it is clear that Cavuto's tenure at Fox News was a significant one, spanning nearly three decades. During his time at the network, Cavuto established himself as a respected and influential figure, known for his insightful analysis and engaging on-air presence.

As for Fox News itself, the network has long been a dominant force in the cable news landscape, known for its conservative-leaning programming and its ability to attract a large and loyal audience. Cavuto's departure, while notable, is unlikely to have a significant impact on the overall operations and success of the network, which continues to be a major player in the media industry.

In conclusion, while the exact circumstances surrounding Neil Cavuto's departure from Fox News in 2024 are not entirely clear, it is evident that he was a long-standing and influential figure at the network, and his exit marks the end of an era for both Cavuto and Fox News.</data>
