      <data key="d5">Shiv Sena is a regional political party in Maharashtra, India, founded by Bal Thackeray. The party has a strong presence in the state, particularly in Thane and neighboring regions, where its leadership has been strengthened by prominent figures like Anand Dighe and Eknath Shinde.

Anand Dighe was a prominent leader within the Shiv Sena, known for his advocacy of Marathi pride and rights. His leadership played a significant role in strengthening the party's presence in Thane and surrounding areas. Eknath Shinde, another Shiv Sena leader, was previously a member of the party before splitting off to form a new government.

The Shiv Sena is a regional political party that has been active in Maharashtra politics for decades. It was founded by Bal Thackeray, who was a charismatic and influential figure in the state's political landscape. The party has traditionally championed the cause of Marathi pride and the rights of the Marathi-speaking population in Maharashtra.

Despite the party's regional focus, it has also played a significant role in national politics, often aligning with or opposing various national parties and coalitions. The party's political fortunes have ebbed and flowed over the years, with periods of strong influence and periods of relative decline.

In recent years, the Shiv Sena has faced some internal turmoil, with the split led by Eknath Shinde being a notable example. However, the party remains a significant political force in Maharashtra, with a strong base of support among the Marathi-speaking population.

      <data key="d5">The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is a national political party in India that has played a significant role in the recent political developments in Maharashtra. The party has a majority in the Maharashtra Assembly and has been supporting the new government formed by Eknath Shinde after he split from the Shiv Sena.

The BJP's involvement in the Maharashtra political scenario began when Eknath Shinde, a senior Shiv Sena leader, formed a new government with the support of the BJP. This move came after Shinde had split from the Shiv Sena, which was previously in a coalition government with the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) and the Indian National Congress (INC).

The BJP's support for Eknath Shinde's group has been crucial in the formation of the new government in Maharashtra. The party's majority in the state assembly has enabled it to provide the necessary backing for Shinde's faction to establish a stable government.

The BJP's role in the Maharashtra political landscape has been a subject of much discussion and debate. While some have praised the party's strategic move to align with Shinde's group, others have criticized it as a power-grabbing exercise. Nonetheless, the BJP's involvement has been a significant factor in the ongoing political dynamics in the state.

It is important to note that the descriptions provided do not appear to be contradictory, but rather complementary in nature. The information suggests that the BJP has been actively involved in the political developments in Maharashtra, supporting Eknath Shinde's group and playing a crucial role in the formation of the new government.

In conclusion, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has been a central player in the recent political events in Maharashtra. The party's support for Eknath Shinde's group, after the latter's split from the Shiv Sena, has been instrumental in the establishment of the new government in the state. The BJP's majority in the Maharashtra Assembly has enabled it to provide the necessary backing for Shinde's faction, solidifying its position in the state's political landscape.</data>

      <data key="d6">Shiv Sena is a regional political party in India, primarily based in the state of Maharashtra. Eknath Shinde is a senior leader within the Shiv Sena party. He has held a prominent position within the party for several years.

Recently, Eknath Shinde has split from the main Shiv Sena party and formed a new government in Maharashtra in alliance with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). This move has been seen as a significant political development in the state.

Prior to the split, Eknath Shinde was a member of the Shiv Sena party. He had been a long-standing leader within the organization, contributing to its growth and influence in Maharashtra politics. However, due to some internal differences or disagreements, Shinde decided to break away from the main Shiv Sena party and form a new political alliance with the BJP.

The reasons behind Shinde's decision to split from Shiv Sena and join hands with the BJP are not entirely clear from the information provided. It is possible that there were ideological or strategic differences between Shinde and the existing Shiv Sena leadership, leading to the split.

Regardless of the specific reasons, Eknath Shinde's move has had significant political implications in Maharashtra. By forming a new government with the BJP, he has effectively challenged the authority of the previous Shiv Sena-led government in the state. This development has the potential to reshape the political landscape in Maharashtra and could have broader ramifications for the state's governance and policymaking.

Overall, Eknath Shinde's transition from a senior Shiv Sena leader to the head of a new government in alliance with the BJP represents a significant political shift in Maharashtra. The comprehensive summary of the available information highlights Shinde's prominent role within Shiv Sena, his decision to split from the party, and the resulting political changes in the state.</data>
