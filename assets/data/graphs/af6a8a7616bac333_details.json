The Nationals, a center-right party within the Coalition, have split from the alliance, citing concerns about the direction of the broader conservative bloc. This split highlights the challenges the Coalition faces in maintaining unity and cohesion.\n\nThe rise of right-wing populism, exemplified by the growing influence of parties like One Nation, has also been a concern for the Nationals, as they seek to maintain their center-right positioning in the face of these more extreme movements. The Coalition's ability to appeal to a broad range of voters may be further complicated by these dynamics.\n\nOverall, the community is in a state of flux, with significant political shifts and internal divisions that could have far-reaching consequences for the country's governance and policy direction.",
