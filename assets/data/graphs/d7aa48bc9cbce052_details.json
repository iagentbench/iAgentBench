The Board aims to resolve international conflicts and has attracted the involvement of other key figures, such as Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban and NATO chief Mark Rutte. \n\nTrump is the chairman of the Board of Peace and has been actively involved in global diplomacy, including meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to discuss the Russia-Ukraine conflict. The community also includes Trump's special envoy, Steve Witkoff, who will travel to Moscow to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin, accompanied by Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner.\n\nAdditionally, the Catholic Church, particularly through the leadership of the late Pope Francis, has a significant presence in the community. Pope Francis was a vocal advocate for peace in the Gaza conflict and maintained regular contact with the local Christian community. Trump's respect for the Pope, as demonstrated by his condolences and plans to attend the funeral, suggests a complex relationship between the former president and the Catholic Church.\n\nOverall, the entities and relationships within this community suggest a significant potential for impact on global affairs and conflict resolution, with the involvement of high-profile figures and organizations. However, the community's actions and decisions could also lead to unintended consequences or heightened tensions in certain regions, depending on the competing interests and agendas at play.",
