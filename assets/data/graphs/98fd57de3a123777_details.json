The Liberal Party's perceived association with the policies and political style of former US President Donald Trump has also been a liability, contributing to the party's electoral challenges.\n\nKey individuals within the Liberal Party, such as Dan Tehan, Katie Allen, Melissa Price, and others, are playing important roles in shaping the party's future direction. The appointment of former party heavyweights to scrutinize the party's performance suggests a recognition of the need for a critical self-assessment and potential course correction.\n\nUltimately, the Liberal Party's ability to reconnect with the Australian people, distance itself from Trump-like influences, and navigate the complex political landscape will be crucial in determining the party's future and the broader impact on Australian politics.",
