Smotrich has been involved in various political and economic matters, including the ongoing conflict in Gaza and the proposed hostage deal. He has been a vocal opponent of the hostage deal, threatening to leave the government if the terms of the deal do not meet his conditions. Smotrich's views on the 2005 disengagement from Gaza and the expansion of settlements in the West Bank align with the right-wing agenda of the Religious Zionist Party. The tensions between Smotrich and other political figures, such as Moshe Gafni, Yair Golan, and Avigdor Liberman, highlight the complex dynamics within the Israeli political landscape. Additionally, the significance of the date \"October 7\" in Israeli history suggests that it has had a profound impact on the national conversation, particularly around national security and the role of different segments of Israeli society.",
