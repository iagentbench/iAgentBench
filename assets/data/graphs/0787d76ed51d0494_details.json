He earned degrees from prestigious institutions like Duke University and Yale Law School, and held leadership roles at organizations like Freddie Mac and The Palmieri Company. This expertise likely contributed to his selection as IRS Commissioner.\n\nKoskinen's relationships with key entities, such as the NTEU (the IRS employee union) and senior IRS officials, as well as his interactions with the Obama administration and Republican lawmakers, shaped his tenure and the challenges he faced. The political tensions between Koskinen and the Republican Party, particularly the House Freedom Caucus, were a significant aspect of his time as Commissioner.\n\nAfter his tenure, Koskinen has remained involved in various professional and civic activities, including writing guest essays and being associated with the law firm Gibson Dunn.
