      <data key="d2">7.0</data>
      <data key="d5">Nihal is a character in the TV series "Amor Prohibido". She is the daughter of Adnan, a central figure in the show. Nihal is portrayed as a complex and multifaceted character with a range of emotions and relationships.

One aspect of Nihal's character is her disapproval of Bihter, another key character, spending time with Behlül. Nihal seems to have a strong dislike or distrust of this relationship, perhaps out of a sense of loyalty to her father or her own personal feelings.

However, the descriptions also reveal that Nihal has a secret love for Behlül herself. This creates an interesting dynamic, as Nihal is torn between her disapproval of Bihter's relationship with Behlül and her own hidden feelings for him.

Nihal is also shown to be heartbroken when she witnesses her father Adnan kissing Bihter. This suggests a close relationship between Nihal and her father, and that she is deeply affected by his actions.

Furthermore, the descriptions indicate that Nihal is not always obedient or compliant. She lied to her father in order to go to a bar with her friend Pelina, and was upset that her father would not be there for her birthday. This suggests a more rebellious side to Nihal's character, and a desire for independence and autonomy.

Overall, the descriptions paint a picture of Nihal as a complex and multifaceted character, with a range of emotions, relationships, and behaviors. She is torn between her disapproval of Bihter's relationship with Behlül and her own secret love for him, while also navigating her relationship with her father and asserting her own independence. The contradictions in the descriptions are reconciled by understanding Nihal as a character with depth and nuance, rather than a one-dimensional figure.</data>

      <data key="d5">Behlül is a central character in the TV series "Amor Prohibido". He is involved in a complex web of romantic relationships and entanglements.

Behlül returns home to investigate what Fatma did to Hilmi. During this time, he develops a close relationship with Bihter, who cares for him when he is sick. This causes Behlül to start seeing Bihter in a different light.

Behlül's relationship with Bihter is viewed differently by another character, Nihal. Behlül is the focus of romantic interests from both Nihal and Bihter, leading to a complicated love triangle.

Despite the contradictory descriptions, a coherent summary can be drawn. Behlül is a character who returns home and becomes embroiled in a romantic situation involving multiple women. He develops a relationship with Bihter, which is viewed differently by Nihal, another woman with romantic feelings for Behlül.

Behlül's primary motivation upon returning home is to investigate what Fatma did to Hilmi, suggesting there may be a deeper mystery or conflict underlying the romantic entanglements. The descriptions indicate that Behlül's relationships and actions are central to the plot of "Amor Prohibido".

In summary, Behlül is a complex character who finds himself at the center of a web of romantic relationships and investigations in the TV series "Amor Prohibido". His interactions with Bihter, Nihal, and the mystery surrounding Fatma and Hilmi drive the narrative forward.</data>

      <data key="d6">Bihter and Adnan are a married couple whose relationship has been the subject of much discussion and controversy.

Adnan, a wealthy and influential businessman, proposed marriage to Bihter, despite facing objections from Fatma, a family member. Despite the initial opposition, Bihter and Adnan ultimately decided to get married, and Bihter moved into the Ziyagil mansion, Adnan's family home.

The marriage between Bihter and Adnan, however, has not been without its challenges. At one point, Bihter is said to have reconciled with Adnan in an attempt to make Behlül, another character, jealous. This suggests that there may have been some underlying tensions or issues within the marriage.

Despite these apparent difficulties, Bihter and Adnan have remained married, and their relationship continues to be a central focus of the narrative. The descriptions provided suggest that their marriage is complex, with both moments of harmony and discord.

It is important to note that the information provided is limited, and there may be additional details or context that could help to further understand the nature of Bihter and Adnan's relationship. However, based on the descriptions given, it appears that their marriage is a significant and multifaceted aspect of the overall story.</data>

      <data key="d6">Fatma and Hilmi are two individuals involved in a dispute. According to the provided descriptions, Hilmi has accused Fatma and her daughters of being con artists.

Hilmi has warned Adnan, another individual, that Fatma and her daughters were con artists. This suggests that Hilmi believes Fatma and her daughters are engaged in some form of fraudulent or deceptive activities.

However, the descriptions do not provide any further details about the specific nature of the alleged con artistry or the evidence supporting Hilmi's accusations. The descriptions also do not indicate whether Fatma and her daughters have been formally charged or convicted of any crimes.

Given the limited information provided, it is difficult to determine the full context and veracity of Hilmi's claims. Without additional details or corroborating evidence, it would be premature to conclude that Fatma and her daughters are definitively con artists.

It is important to note that accusations alone do not necessarily equate to guilt, and the principles of due process and the presumption of innocence should be upheld. If further information becomes available, it may be necessary to revisit and potentially revise this summary to ensure it accurately reflects the situation.

In summary, the available data indicates that Hilmi has accused Fatma and her daughters of being con artists, but the specific details and evidence supporting this claim are not provided. The summary is limited to the information given, and any definitive conclusions about the nature of the dispute or the guilt of the parties involved would require additional investigation and verification.</data>
