GLP-1 is a hormone that helps regulate blood sugar levels, and by mimicking its action, orforglipron can improve glycemic control in people with type 2 diabetes. The oral administration of orforglipron, as opposed to injectable GLP-1 agonists, may make it a more convenient option for patients and potentially improve adherence to treatment.
