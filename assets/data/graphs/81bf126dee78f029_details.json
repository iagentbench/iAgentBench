Additionally, Ford has had complex relationships with other prominent political figures in Canada, including Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and former Ontario Premier Kathleen Wynne.\n\nDuring his time as Premier, Ford has enacted several notable policy initiatives, such as the \"Strong Mayors, Building Homes Act\" and the \"Your Health Act (Bill 60)\". However, his tenure has also been marked by controversies, such as the \"Greenbelt scandal\" and his handling of the COVID-19 pandemic.
