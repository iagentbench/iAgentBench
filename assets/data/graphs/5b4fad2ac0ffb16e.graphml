      <data key="d5">Robert Putnam is a prominent American political scientist and professor at Harvard University. He is best known for his work on the concept of social capital and its decline in the United States, as well as his research on the role of religion in American society.

Putnam is the co-author of the book "American Grace: How Religion Divides and Unites Us," which he wrote with David Campbell. The book explores the changing attitudes and behaviors of Americans towards religion, examining how religious beliefs and practices have both divided and united the country. Putnam and Campbell's research in this book has provided valuable insights into the complex relationship between religion and American society.

In addition to his work on religion, Putnam is also renowned for his book "Bowling Alone," which examines the decline of social capital in America. In this influential work, Putnam argues that Americans have become increasingly disconnected from their communities, with a decrease in participation in civic organizations, social networks, and other forms of social engagement. This decline, he suggests, has had significant consequences for the overall well-being and cohesion of American society.

Putnam's academic background is in political science, and he has worked extensively in the field of comparative politics, exploring the role of social capital and civic engagement in different political systems. He has collaborated with various scholars, including David Campbell, with whom he worked during their graduate school days.

Overall, Robert Putnam is a highly respected and influential figure in the social sciences, known for his groundbreaking research on the changing nature of American society and the importance of social capital and civic engagement. His work has had a significant impact on our understanding of the complex social and political dynamics that shape the United States.</data>

      <data key="d4">Robert Putnam two...</data>
      <data key="d6">David Campbell and Robert Putnam are two prominent American political scientists who have collaborated on research examining the role of religion in American society. 

In their book "American Grace: How Religion Divides and Unites Us," Campbell and Putnam explore the changing religious landscape in the United States. The book, published in 2010, analyzes data from multiple surveys to understand how religious affiliation, beliefs, and practices have evolved over recent decades. 

The authors find that while religion has the potential to both divide and unite Americans, on the whole it has played a unifying role in society. They document a decline in traditional religious affiliation, particularly among younger generations, but also observe that many Americans maintain strong personal religious beliefs and practices even if they do not formally belong to a religious institution.

Campbell and Putnam's research highlights how religious diversity has increased in the U.S., with a growing number of Americans identifying as religiously unaffiliated or belonging to non-Christian faiths. At the same time, the book examines how religious communities have adapted to these changes, forging new connections across traditional divides.

Overall, "American Grace" provides a comprehensive and nuanced understanding of the role of religion in contemporary American life. By drawing on extensive data and analysis, Campbell and Putnam offer insights into how religious beliefs, practices, and affiliations have shifted, and the implications these changes have for American society, politics, and culture.

The collaborative work of David Campbell and Robert Putnam on this influential book demonstrates their shared expertise and commitment to understanding the complex relationship between religion and American public life. Their research has contributed significantly to scholarly and public debates around the evolving place of religion in the United States.</data>
