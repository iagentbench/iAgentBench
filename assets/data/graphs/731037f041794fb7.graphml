      <data key="d2">8.0</data>
      <data key="d5">U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) is a federal government agency responsible for a wide range of border security and enforcement duties. As the primary law enforcement agency at U.S. borders, CBP is tasked with regulating and facilitating international trade, collecting import duties, and enforcing various U.S. laws and regulations, including those related to immigration and drug trafficking.

In carrying out its mandate, CBP has been involved in several high-profile incidents. The agency was responsible for the wrongful detention of Hugo Monteiro, a case that highlighted concerns about potential civil liberties violations. CBP also conducted a raid on a home in North Hills that was suspected of being a human smuggling hub, demonstrating its role in combating illegal cross-border activities.

Additionally, CBP has detained individuals who have accidentally or inadvertently crossed the border, such as Sarahi and her children. These cases underscore the complex and sensitive nature of border enforcement, where the agency must balance security concerns with the rights and wellbeing of individuals.

Furthermore, CBP has been involved in the detention of Bachir Atallah and Jessica Fakhri at the border, though the specific circumstances surrounding these cases are not provided in the information given.

Overall, U.S. Customs and Border Protection plays a crucial role in securing the nation's borders and enforcing a wide range of laws and regulations. However, its actions have also drawn scrutiny and criticism in certain instances, highlighting the need for continued oversight and accountability to ensure the agency's practices align with principles of fairness, due process, and respect for civil liberties.</data>

      <data key="d2">6.0</data>
      <data key="d5">The Ambassador Bridge is a border crossing that connects the cities of Detroit, Michigan in the United States and Windsor, Ontario in Canada. It spans the Detroit River and is a crucial transportation link between the two countries.

The bridge is a one-way toll road, meaning that vehicles traveling from Canada to the United States must pay a toll to cross, while vehicles traveling from the U.S. to Canada do not. This arrangement can be confusing for local residents who may not be familiar with the toll system.

The area around the Ambassador Bridge is known to be a location where border crossings and customs inspections can be a complex and sometimes challenging experience. This was the case for Sarahi, who was detained at the Ambassador Bridge during a crossing.

The Ambassador Bridge is an important economic and transportation asset, facilitating the movement of goods, services, and people between the United States and Canada. However, the bridge's location and the procedures involved in crossing the border can be a source of confusion and frustration for some travelers, as evidenced by Sarahi's experience of being detained at the crossing.

In summary, the Ambassador Bridge is a vital border crossing between the U.S. and Canada, but the toll system and the customs and immigration procedures involved can make the crossing process complex and sometimes challenging for travelers, as was the case for Sarahi.</data>
