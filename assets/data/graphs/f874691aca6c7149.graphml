      <data key="d5">Post-Grant Review (PGR) is a type of patent dispute proceeding heard by the Patent Trial and Appeal Board (PTAB) of the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO). It is a procedure for challenging the validity of a patent after it has been granted.

The purpose of Post-Grant Review is to provide a mechanism for third parties to challenge the validity of a patent on various grounds, including lack of novelty, obviousness, and failure to meet the written description or enablement requirements. This process allows for a more thorough examination of the patent's validity, which can help to ensure that only valid patents are enforced.

The Post-Grant Review process begins with the filing of a petition by a third party, who must demonstrate that it has standing to challenge the patent. The PTAB then determines whether to institute a review, based on the merits of the petition. If a review is instituted, the parties engage in discovery and submit briefs, and the PTAB ultimately issues a final written decision on the validity of the patent.

One of the key features of Post-Grant Review is that it provides a faster and more cost-effective alternative to traditional patent litigation in federal court. The PTAB is required to issue a final written decision within 12 months of instituting the review, which can be significantly faster than the timeline for a federal court case. Additionally, the PTAB proceedings are generally less expensive than litigation, making it a more accessible option for challenging patent validity.

Overall, Post-Grant Review is an important tool for ensuring the quality and validity of issued patents, and for providing a more efficient and cost-effective means of resolving patent disputes. By allowing third parties to challenge the validity of patents, the process helps to maintain the integrity of the patent system and promote innovation.</data>

      <data key="d2">10.0</data>
      <data key="d5">Fintiv is a company involved in a PTAB (Patent Trial and Appeal Board) proceeding, as well as a precedential PTAB decision that set forth factors for discretionary denial of IPR (Inter Partes Review) and PGR (Post-Grant Review) petitions.

The Fintiv decision, issued by the PTAB in 2020, established a framework for determining whether to exercise discretion to deny institution of an IPR or PGR petition based on the advanced state of a parallel proceeding in another forum, such as district court litigation. The decision outlined six factors to be considered in this analysis:

1. Whether the court granted a stay of the parallel proceeding or the petitioner filed a motion to stay the parallel proceeding;
2. The proximity of the court's trial date to the Board's projected statutory deadline for a final written decision;
3. The investment in the parallel proceeding by the court and the parties;
4. The overlap between issues raised in the petition and in the parallel proceeding;
5. Whether the petitioner and the defendant in the parallel proceeding are the same party; and
6. Other circumstances that impact the Board's exercise of discretion, including the merits.

The Fintiv decision has had a significant impact on PTAB proceedings, as it has provided a framework for the Board to consider the potential for duplicative efforts and the efficient use of Board resources when deciding whether to institute an IPR or PGR petition. The decision has been widely cited and applied in subsequent PTAB proceedings, and has become an important consideration for parties involved in PTAB trials.

In summary, Fintiv is both a company involved in a PTAB proceeding and a precedential PTAB decision that has established a framework for the Board to exercise its discretion in determining whether to institute IPR and PGR petitions, particularly in cases where there is a parallel proceeding in another forum, such as district court litigation.</data>
