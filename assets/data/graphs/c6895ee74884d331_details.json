"explanation": "The English Defence League (EDL) is a far-right, Islamophobic political movement that was founded in 2009 by Tommy Robinson, whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon. Initially, the EDL claimed to be a non-violent, anti-extremist group, but it quickly gained a reputation for promoting anti-Muslim rhetoric and engaging in violent confrontations. Robinson led the EDL from its inception until 2013, when he announced that he was leaving the group, stating that it had become too extreme. Despite Robinson's departure, the EDL continued to operate, with various splinter groups and offshoots emerging in the following years. The group has been widely condemned for its divisive agenda and promotion of intolerance. [Data: Entities (0, 5); Relationships (0, 138)]",
