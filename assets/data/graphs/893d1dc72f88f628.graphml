According to the provided descriptions, there appears to be some contradictory information regarding the association's stance on the nurses' conduct. One description states that Whaites has "expressed disgust at the nurses' conduct," while the other description says that the association "condemned the nurses' conduct."

To resolve this contradiction, it seems that the association, under the leadership of Michael Whaites, has taken a stance against the conduct of the nurses, though the specific nature of the conduct is not clearly defined in the given information. It is possible that the association felt the need to publicly condemn the actions of some of its members, which may have led Whaites to express his personal disgust at the situation.

In summary, the NSW Nurses and Midwives' Association, led by general secretary Michael Whaites, has taken a stance against the conduct of some of its members, though the exact details of the situation are not entirely clear from the provided descriptions. The association has publicly condemned the nurses' actions, and Whaites has personally expressed his disapproval of the situation.</data>
