      <data key="d2">7.0</data>
      <data key="d5">The case of "CHEN V. HOWARD-ANDERSON" involves a legal dispute surrounding the merger of Occam Networks and Calix. Levi &amp; Korsinsky, a law firm, obtained a preliminary injunction against the merger due to material representations and omissions in the proxy statement.

The key details of the case are as follows:

The case, known as Chen v. Howard-Anderson, No. 5878-VCL (Del. Ch. Jan. 24, 2011), was filed in the Delaware Court of Chancery. Levi &amp; Korsinsky, acting on behalf of the plaintiffs, successfully obtained a preliminary injunction to halt the merger between Occam Networks and Calix.

The basis for the injunction was that the proxy statement, which was provided to shareholders to inform their decision on the merger, contained material misrepresentations and omissions. These issues with the proxy statement were deemed significant enough by the court to warrant the preliminary injunction, temporarily preventing the merger from proceeding.

The case highlights the importance of accurate and transparent disclosure in corporate transactions, particularly when shareholders are being asked to vote on a merger or acquisition. The court's decision to grant the preliminary injunction suggests that the court found the concerns raised by Levi &amp; Korsinsky to be valid and warranting of further scrutiny before the merger could be allowed to move forward.

Overall, the "CHEN V. HOWARD-ANDERSON" case demonstrates the legal protections available to shareholders when they are presented with potentially misleading information regarding a proposed corporate transaction. The preliminary injunction obtained by Levi &amp; Korsinsky serves as a reminder to companies to ensure that their disclosures are complete and accurate, in order to uphold their fiduciary duties to shareholders.</data>
