The flight was en route from Newark, New Jersey to San Francisco, California when it was seized by a group of al-Qaeda terrorists. The hijackers took control of the aircraft and diverted it towards Washington, D.C., with the likely intention of crashing it into a high-profile target, such as the White House or the United States Capitol building. However, the passengers and crew members on board became aware of the hijacking through phone calls with loved ones on the ground.

After a violent struggle in the cabin, the plane ultimately crashed in a field near Shanksville, Pennsylvania, killing all 44 people on board.
