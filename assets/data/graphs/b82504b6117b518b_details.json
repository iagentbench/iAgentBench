Noem's handling of the Pretti shooting incident and her perceived lack of cooperation with the Walz administration in Minnesota have been the primary sources of controversy.\n\nThe community also involves former President Donald Trump, who has been called upon by Fetterman to fire Noem from her position, as well as other key figures such as Tom Homan, a former \"border czar,\" and media outlets like Fox News, the New York Post, and the Washington Examiner, which have covered the events and controversies surrounding Noem and the DHS.\n\nThe broader political implications of the community include the potential for continued unrest and conflict, the polarization of the issues, and the involvement of high-profile political figures that could lead to further scrutiny and consequences for Noem and the DHS. The Framers' provision of the power of impeachment as a check on the executive branch also suggests that the community's issues could have broader implications for the balance of power within the federal government.",
