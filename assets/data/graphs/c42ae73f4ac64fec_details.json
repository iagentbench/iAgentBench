"explanation": "The Capitol Riot on January 6, 2021 was a violent attack on the United States Capitol building, carried out by a mob of supporters of former President Donald Trump. The riot occurred after Trump had repeatedly made false claims of widespread voter fraud in the 2020 presidential election, which he lost to Joe Biden. In the lead-up to the riot, Trump had encouraged his supporters to attend a rally in Washington D.C. on January 6th, the day that Congress was set to certify Biden's electoral victory. At the rally, Trump continued to push his false claims of election fraud and urged his supporters to \"fight like hell\" against the results. This inflammatory rhetoric from the president is widely seen as having incited and encouraged the subsequent attack on the Capitol. [Data: Relationships (129, 229, 230)]",
