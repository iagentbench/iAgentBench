      <data key="d6">The World Trade Center and the September 11, 2001 Terrorist Attacks

On September 11, 2001, the World Trade Center in New York City was the target of a devastating terrorist attack. Two hijacked commercial airliners were deliberately flown into the twin towers of the World Trade Center, causing the complete collapse of both buildings.

The World Trade Center was a complex of seven buildings in Lower Manhattan, with the iconic twin towers being the centerpiece. The towers were among the tallest buildings in the world at the time, standing at 110 stories each. They were a symbol of American economic power and global commerce.

On the morning of September 11th, 2001, 19 militants associated with the Islamic extremist group al-Qaeda hijacked four airplanes and carried out suicide attacks against targets in the United States. Two of the planes were flown into the twin towers of the World Trade Center, a third plane hit the Pentagon just outside Washington, D.C., and the fourth plane crashed in a field in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.

The attacks on the World Trade Center towers were the deadliest act of terrorism on U.S. soil. When the planes struck the towers, they caused immense damage and triggered the complete collapse of both buildings. The collapse of the towers sent out massive clouds of dust and debris, causing widespread destruction and loss of life in the surrounding area.

In total, 2,996 people were killed in the 9/11 attacks, which were the deadliest act of terrorism on U.S. soil. The majority of the casualties occurred at the World Trade Center, where 2,763 people were killed. Hundreds of firefighters, police officers, and other first responders also lost their lives trying to rescue people from the towers.

The 9/11 attacks had a profound and lasting impact on the United States and the world. They led to major U.S. initiatives to combat terrorism, including the creation of the Department of Homeland Security and the enactment of the USA PATRIOT Act. The attacks also had significant economic and geopolitical consequences, as the U.S. launched a global war on terrorism in response.

The collapse of the World Trade Center towers was a tragic and devastating event that will forever be remembered as a pivotal moment in American history. The memory of those who lost their lives on that fateful day continues to be honored and commemorated by people around the world.</data>
