Noem has faced scrutiny over her handling of the 2021 incident involving former Attorney General Jason Ravnsborg, as well as allegations of campaign finance irregularities, misuse of state funds, and potential conflicts of interest related to her family's business interests. \n\nNoem's relationship with the federal government, particularly her brief tenure as Homeland Security Secretary, has also been a source of significant controversy. Her actions and decisions in this role have led to criticism and calls for her impeachment or dismissal from both Democratic and Republican lawmakers, with concerns raised about her oversight of agencies like ICE and her involvement in incidents that resulted in the deaths of civilians.\n\nDespite the controversies, Noem has maintained the support of the Republican Party, with the data suggesting that GOP lawmakers have largely rallied around her and dismissed the allegations as politically motivated attacks. However, the severity of the impact posed by Noem's actions and the growing calls for accountability have resulted in a high impact severity rating of 7.5, with the potential for further unrest and instability within the community.",
