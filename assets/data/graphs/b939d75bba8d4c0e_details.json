Depending on the nature and severity of the violations committed by these officers, their continued employment or involvement with the department could jeopardize public safety, lead to civil rights violations, or expose the community to other forms of harm.

The decertification of other officers, such as Victor L. Middlebrook, also indicates that their conduct was deemed severe enough to warrant their removal from law enforcement. These factors underscore the need for the Forest Park Police Department to thoroughly investigate and address any issues with its personnel to mitigate potential risks to the community.
